## What This Is (Plain Language)

**AI-Workflow-Orchestration (AWO)** — also referred to as the **Epistemic Orchestration Method (EOM)** — is a methodology project that defines how to structure, critique, and validate AI-assisted research.  

The project includes reproducible workflow logs, documentation practices, and case studies. Its purpose is to make **AI–human orchestration** transparent and trustworthy, bridging the gap between *automation* and *explanation* in knowledge production.

---

## Why It Matters

AI is no longer just a tool — it’s part of the research pipeline. That raises critical questions:  

- How do we know what we know when AI is in the loop?  
- What standards make AI-assisted research trustworthy?  
- What counts as “explanation” versus “automation”?  
- How do we formalize **human-in-the-loop oversight** as part of the knowledge pipeline?  

AWO/EOM tackles these questions by turning abstract epistemology into a **concrete workflow method**.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Workflow design & quality gates** – checkpoints to ensure clarity and reproducibility.  
- **Methodology development** – structuring epistemic standards for AI research.  
- **Clear communication of complex processes** – bridging technical and non-technical audiences.  
- **Research reproducibility** – workflow logs, documentation templates, and case studies.  

---

## Deliverables

- **Workflow logs** – chronological records of project evolution.  
- **Documentation templates** – reproducible structures for validation.  
- **Case studies** – applied demonstrations (Waveframe as first).  
- **Theory notes** – connecting workflows to epistemological framing.
