## What This Is

AI is moving fast, but most projects lack **reproducible workflows**.  
The **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** framework makes AI projects **transparent, auditable, and transferable** by combining structured human oversight with reproducible documentation.  

AWO is not a coding library — it’s a **methodological framework**. Its goal is to turn AI-assisted work into something that can be trusted, traced, and reused across domains.  

---

## Why It Matters

AI isn’t just a tool — it’s part of the workflow itself. That raises new challenges:  

- How do we validate outputs without blind trust?  
- How do we reproduce results across teams and contexts?  
- How do we balance speed with rigor?  

**AWO addresses these questions** by transforming ad-hoc AI use into a structured, repeatable orchestration method.

## Core Principles

- **Falsifiability First** → outputs must be disprovable, not just impressive  
- **AI as Partner** → models act as collaborators, not opaque black boxes  
- **Process Over Outcome** → the rigor of inquiry matters as much as results  

---

## Workflow Cycle

1. **Define Question** → Frame the inquiry clearly  
2. **Orchestrate AI** → Deploy models to explore possibilities  
3. **Validate** → Stress-test outputs with logic, data, or constraints  
4. **Document** → Capture decisions, failures, and results  
5. **Synthesize** → Distill findings into usable knowledge

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Workflow design & process engineering** → structuring projects for clarity and repeatability  
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** → embedding falsifiability and validation in AI use  
- **Reproducibility practices** → workflow logs, documentation templates, audit trails  
- **Applied analysis** → translating orchestration into science, business, and social domains  
- **Method development** → frameworks for scaling AI–human collaboration  

---

## Deliverables

- **Workflow Logs** → timestamped records of project decisions  
- **Documentation Templates** → reusable structures for reproducible inquiry  
- **Case Studies** → applied demonstrations of AWO in practice  

A first applied demonstration (customer review analysis) is under development and will be linked here when published.

## Roles in AWO

- **Orchestrator (Human):** Frames direction, applies falsifiability, validates outputs  
- **AI Models:** Generate alternatives, surface blind spots, accelerate iteration  
- **Orchestration Layer:** Captures logs, integrates outputs, ensures reproducibility  

---

## Logs

Logs are stored in the [`logs/`](logs) directory.  
Each file is timestamped for clarity and archival purposes.  

Logs demonstrate how AWO tracks **decisions, alternatives, and validations** across the project lifecycle.
