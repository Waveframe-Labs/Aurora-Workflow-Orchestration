# ADR-0017 — Documentation Governance under Aurora Research Initiative
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Version:** AWO v1.2.0  
**Maintainer:** Shawn C. Wright  
**Affiliation:** Aurora Research Initiative · Waveframe Labs Division

---

## Context
With AWO transitioning from individual authorship to institutional governance, document stewardship must align with the Aurora Research Initiative’s standards for transparency, attribution, and reproducibility.

---

## Decision
All AWO documentation, specifications, and workflow outputs are now governed under the **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)**.  
Governance responsibilities include:
- Maintaining authorship, licensing, and DOI metadata.  
- Approving structural or methodological changes before version tagging.  
- Ensuring all released artifacts (Markdown, PDF, schema, workflow logs) meet ARI reproducibility and licensing criteria.

---

## Consequences
- Institutional identity replaces personal authorship in official releases.  
- Documentation inherits ARI’s version control, licensing, and archival standards.  
- All subsequent projects (e.g., CRI-CORE) reference AWO as a governed baseline.

---

## Alternatives Considered
- **Independent personal maintenance:** rejected for sustainability and credibility reasons.  
- **Delegation to Waveframe Labs only:** rejected to preserve cross-initiative neutrality.
