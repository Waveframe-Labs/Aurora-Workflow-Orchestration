# ADR-0006-licensing
**Title:** Dual Licensing for Method and Code  
**Status:** Accepted  

## Context  
AWO spans both methodological text (whitepapers, logs, documentation) and executable code (schemas, runner scripts, workflows). Each has different reuse and attribution needs.  

## Decision  
- All code, automation, and pipeline scripts remain under **Apache-2.0**.  
- All text, logs, templates, and documentation are licensed under **CC BY 4.0**.  

## Consequences  
- Maximizes adoption for code without lock-in.  
- Preserves attribution for text and method documentation.  
- Requires contributors to respect both licenses.
