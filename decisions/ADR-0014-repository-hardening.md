# Workflow Log — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

This log chronicles the verified development of **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**.  
Each entry corresponds to a public GitHub release tag and documented repository state.  
Format: **What I did, What I learned, Next step.**

---

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.0 Initial Public Release
- **What I did:** Published the first public release of the AWO framework. Defined core orchestration roles (Primary Engine, Supporting Models, Human-in-the-Loop). Implemented baseline reproducibility mechanisms — environment pins, logs, and deterministic runners.  
- **What I learned:** Reproducibility is not just about code; it’s a behavioral protocol. Role separation and structured critique loops are essential for credible AI-assisted research.  
- **Next step:** Prepare repository for DOI integration and archival validation.

---

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.2 Zenodo Integration & DOI Preparation
- **What I did:** Added `.zenodo.json` and `CITATION.cff` for metadata governance. Verified Zenodo webhook and minted the **concept DOI**. Updated README badges and licensing.  
- **What I learned:** Formal citation infrastructure transforms a repository from a project into an archival artifact. DOI traceability ensures provenance and accountability.  
- **Next step:** Establish audit and decision frameworks to make AWO self-governing.

---

## 2025-09-02 — v1.1.0 Audit Framework
- **What I did:** Introduced `/decisions/` with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs 0001–0010). Expanded `/logs/` for timestamped audit entries. Added audit-gate support and schemas for falsifiability, provenance, and reproducibility validation.  
- **What I learned:** Governance requires explicit structure — ADRs, manifests, and schema validation convert intent into verifiable evidence.  
- **Next step:** Harden documentation consistency and prepare the repository for long-term organizational stewardship.

---

## 2025-10-11 — v1.1.1 Repository Hardening & Org Transfer Prep
- **What I did:** Standardized `README.md` files across all primary folders. Unified metadata headers (filetype, version, updated, maintainer, contact). Resolved `.github` README override issue and re-established root README as canonical. Updated all references and contact details to `swright@waveframelabs.org`.  
- **What I learned:** Structural clarity directly reinforces auditability. Clear metadata and separated CI documentation prevent governance confusion.  
- **Next step:** Complete organizational migration to **Waveframe Labs** and prepare CRI-CORE integration as the operational execution layer.

---

## Current Status (as of 2025-10-11)
- **What I did:** Finalized **AWO v1.1.1** as a structurally complete, auditable methodology under Waveframe Labs.  
- **What I learned:** AWO has matured from a single-repo framework into the methodological backbone of a reproducible-research ecosystem.  
- **Next step:** Initiate **CRI-CORE** implementation and define AWO–CRI interoperability specifications for enterprise reproducibility.
