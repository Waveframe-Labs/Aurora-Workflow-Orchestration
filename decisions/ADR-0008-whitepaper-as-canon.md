# ADR-0008-whitepaper-as-canon
**Title:** Whitepaper as Canonical Deep Reference  
**Status:** Accepted  

## Context  
README.md is the front-door, but a full explanation of AWO needs structure beyond what a README can hold.  

## Decision  
- The **AWO Whitepaper (docs/AWO_Whitepaper_vX.Y.md)** is the canonical, citable deep reference.  
- The README is intentionally lean, pointing to the whitepaper for depth.  
- All updates to principles, governance, or workflows must first be reflected in the whitepaper.  

## Consequences  
- Prevents drift between repo and spec.  
- Readers get both a quick entry point (README) and a durable deep reference (whitepaper).
