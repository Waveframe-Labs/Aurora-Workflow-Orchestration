# Figures — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

**Purpose**  
This directory contains all visual materials used in the **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** documentation and whitepaper.  
Each figure serves as a reproducible artifact — version-controlled, cited, and referenced in the AWO whitepaper or supporting specifications.

## Versioning & Provenance
- All figures must exist in **both vector (.svg)** and **raster (.png)** formats for long-term usability.  
- File names must match their references exactly in the associated documents.  
- Significant figure updates require:
  1. Incremented documentation version number.  
  2. Update in `/docs/` cross-references.  
  3. Zenodo re-release for archival continuity.

## Rendering & Licensing
- Figures are released under **CC BY 4.0** (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International).  
- High-resolution and source design files (if applicable) should be retained in internal archives but not committed to GitHub.  
- SVG is the preferred master format; PNG is for compatibility in rendered outputs (e.g., PDFs).
