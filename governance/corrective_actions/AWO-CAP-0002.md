# AWO-CAP-0002 — Structural Correction: Removal of /ARI/ Directory

**Date:** 2025-12-01    
**Authority:** Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)  
**Action:** Removed `/ARI/` directory from AWO repository.  
**Rationale:** ARI is now a standalone institutional repository with its own DOI-backed artifacts.  
Keeping ARI materials in AWO violated boundary separation defined by ADR-0017 and the ARI governance framework.  
**Outcome:** Repository scope corrected; AWO now strictly reflects methodological content.  
**Status:** Closed.
