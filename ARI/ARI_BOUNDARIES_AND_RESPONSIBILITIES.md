This document formally defines the jurisdiction, responsibilities, and prohibitions governing  
the interaction between ARI, AWO, CRI-CORE, Waveframe Labs, and all Case Studies.  
It establishes the constitutional separation of powers required for long-term epistemic stability.

---

# 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- prevent role bleeding between governance, method, engine, and applications  
- mandate strict separation of authority  
- ensure each subsystem operates within its allowed scope  
- codify prohibitions that preserve epistemic integrity  
- provide a binding reference during audits and future development

This document is legally binding within the Aurora Research Initiative governance framework.

# 2. ARI — Governance and Epistemic Authority

## 2.1 Responsibilities
ARI is responsible for:

- defining epistemic doctrine  
- setting governance rules  
- establishing metadata and provenance standards  
- defining constraints for AWO and CRI  
- approving structural changes to the ecosystem  
- maintaining the institutional roadmap  
- ensuring independence of validation  

## 2.2 Explicit Prohibitions
ARI may **not**:

- implement method logic  
- implement deterministic execution  
- interpret scientific data or claims  
- build tooling or workflows  
- execute research workflows  
- validate its own changes (requires log + review)

ARI governs.  
ARI does not build.

# 3. AWO — Method and Workflow Framework

## 3.1 Responsibilities
AWO is responsible for:

- implementing ARI’s procedural doctrine  
- providing workflow-based reproducibility  
- orchestrating reasoning steps  
- handling metadata extraction (temporary until CRI takes over)  
- producing transparent, auditable processes  

## 3.2 Explicit Prohibitions
AWO may **not**:

- create or modify epistemic rules  
- approve its own governance changes  
- interpret scientific correctness  
- embed deterministic enforcement  
- override provenance or metadata obligations  
- perform attestation or identity-binding  
- bypass ARI constraints  

AWO executes method.  
AWO does not govern, enforce, or validate.

# 4. CRI-CORE — Deterministic Execution and Enforcement Engine

## 4.1 Responsibilities
CRI-CORE is responsible for:

- enforcing deterministic execution  
- validating artifact integrity  
- performing identity binding  
- performing attestation independence checks  
- running workflows without interpretation  
- ensuring reproducible environmental capture  

## 4.2 Explicit Prohibitions
CRI-CORE may **not**:

- interpret scientific or logical meaning  
- alter workflow logic  
- embed epistemic or governance rules  
- approve or reject research claims  
- modify metadata definitions  
- act as a reasoning engine  
- perform any method-level decision making  

CRI enforces.  
CRI does not reason, decide, or govern.

# 5. Waveframe Labs — Engineering and Implementation

## 5.1 Responsibilities
Waveframe Labs is responsible for:

- developing tools, engines, methods, simulators, and demos  
- implementing AWO and CRI under ARI governance  
- maintaining repositories  
- performing engineering tasks  
- creating case studies and applied demonstrations  

## 5.2 Explicit Prohibitions
Waveframe Labs may **not**:

- define epistemic rules  
- override ARI governance  
- modify ARI doctrine or metadata policy  
- collapse method and engine into one subsystem  
- execute or approve governance-level decisions  

Waveframe Labs builds under ARI authority.

---

# 6. Case Studies — Applied Research

## 6.1 Responsibilities
Case studies:

- apply AWO workflows  
- run under CRI-CORE enforcement  
- produce reproducible scientific artifacts  
- demonstrate the validity of the Aurora ecosystem  

## 6.2 Explicit Prohibitions
Case Studies may **not**:

- alter any governance or epistemic rules  
- modify method logic  
- modify deterministic engine behavior  
- bypass provenance or metadata obligations  
- self-govern under any circumstances  

Case studies demonstrate.  
They do not govern, interpret, or enforce.

# 7. Interfaces and Permissions

| Layer | Can Modify | Cannot Modify |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **ARI** | governance, doctrine, constraints | method logic, CRI internals |
| **AWO** | workflow code, method execution | governance, epistemics, CRI enforcement |
| **CRI-CORE** | deterministic execution engine | workflow logic, epistemics, governance |
| **Waveframe Labs** | tooling, demos | ARI doctrine, governance |
| **Case Studies** | applied research | any core system |

---

# 8. Forbidden Cross-Layer Interactions

The following interactions are formally forbidden:

- AWO interpreting or approving governance  
- CRI implementing method logic  
- Waveframe Labs modifying ARI doctrine  
- Case studies altering any upstream subsystem  
- ARI performing execution  
- Any layer self-approving structural changes  
- Any silent or undocumented modifications  
- Any bypass of provenance or metadata policy  

Violations represent governance failures.

---

# 9. Revisions

All revisions require:

1. Approval by the ARI Institutional Coordinator  
2. Governance log entry  
3. Version increment  
4. Backward linkage  
5. Rationale included in the log  

No silent changes permitted.
