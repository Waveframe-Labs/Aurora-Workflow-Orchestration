This roadmap defines the strategic evolution of the **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** across
multiple phases. It establishes how ARI grows from its foundational architecture into a fully mature
institution governing reproducible AI-human scientific workflows and tooling.

The roadmap ensures long-term structural integrity and prevents governance drift.

---

# 1. Phase I — Foundational Architecture (Current Phase)

**Objective:** Establish ARI as an independent institutional layer.

**Deliverables:**
- ARI repository creation  
- `README.md`  
- `ARI_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- `GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`  
- `INIT_LOG.md`  
- roadmap creation  
- initial folder structure  

**Criteria for completion:**
- Governance baseline stable  
- Architecture baseline established  
- Provenance chain active  
- No major structural inconsistencies remain  

---

# 2. Phase II — Metadata & Epistemic Foundations

**Objective:** Define the epistemic rules and metadata structures that govern the entire Aurora ecosystem.

**Planned documents:**
- `epistemics/EPISTEMIC_DOCTRINE.md`  
- `epistemics/METADATA_POLICY.md`  
- `epistemics/PROVENANCE_SPEC.md`  

**Outcomes:**
- audit-first epistemology codified  
- metadata structure standardized  
- documentation invariants defined  
- provenance schema formalized  

**Dependencies:**  
Requires Phase I to be complete.

---

# 3. Phase III — Integration with AWO v4.2+

**Objective:** Ensure the Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) method is fully aligned with ARI governance.

**Deliverables:**
- governance compliance criteria for workflows  
- metadata enforcement expectations  
- role separation boundaries for AWO  
- integration guidelines between AWO and ARI provenance  

**Goals:**
- AWO adopts ARI policies  
- governance and method boundaries clarified  
- non-deterministic governance removed from AWO  
- execution pipeline operates under ARI-defined epistemic rules  

**Dependencies:**  
Requires metadata & epistemic documents from Phase II.

---

# 4. Phase IV — CRI-CORE Alignment & Onboarding

**Objective:** Transition enforcement and deterministic execution from AWO into CRI-CORE.

**Deliverables:**
- governance requirements for deterministic tooling  
- identity-binding rules  
- attestation-independence criteria  
- provenance verification expectations  
- CRI-CORE onboarding guidelines  

**Goals:**
- clear separation between method (AWO) and engine (CRI)  
- governance constraints formalized for tooling  
- deterministic execution fully delegated to CRI-CORE  

**Dependencies:**  
Requires AWO integration (Phase III).

---

# 5. Phase V — Governance Maturity & Public Transparency

**Objective:** Formalize ARI as a public-facing, reproducible governance institution.

**Deliverables:**
- public governance documentation  
- licensing strategy  
- ARI website section  
- maturity model for governance  
- transparency dashboards  
- versioned public releases  

**Outcomes:**
- public trust  
- transparent accountability  
- governance reproducibility  
- institution-level clarity  

**Dependencies:**  
Phases I–IV completed.

---

# 6. Phase VI — Certification & Ecosystem Expansion

**Objective:** Establish ARI as the governing standard for reproducible scientific workflows.

**Key initiatives:**
- reproducibility certification model  
- multi-agent governance expansion  
- collaboration guidelines  
- case study expansion  
- governance-based validation pathways  

**Long-term outcomes:**
- institutional credibility  
- widespread adoption of ARI-aligned governance  
- AWO and CRI-CORE recognized as reproducible research infrastructure  

---

# 7. Revision & Governance

All roadmap changes must be logged in `logs/GOV_LOG.md` with:
- version increments  
- rationale  
- dependencies noted  
- backward linkage  

No silent changes permitted.

---

This roadmap defines the path toward institutional maturity for the Aurora Research Initiative.
