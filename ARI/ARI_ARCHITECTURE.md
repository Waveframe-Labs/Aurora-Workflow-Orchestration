The **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** serves as the institutional, governance, and epistemic
foundation for the Aurora Workflow Orchestration ecosystem. This document defines ARI’s structure,
scope, responsibilities, authorities, and interaction boundaries with AWO, CRI-CORE, and scientific
case studies.

ARI exists to prevent governance drift, ensure institutional clarity, and provide a stable foundation
for reproducible AI-human scientific workflows.

# 1. Institutional Positioning

ARI is positioned as the **organizational layer above all workflows and tooling**:
```
Waveframe Labs (organization)
└── Aurora Research Initiative (institutional governance)
├── AWO — Method & execution workflow
├── CRI-CORE — Deterministic tooling engine (in development)
└── Scientific Case Studies
├── Waveframe v4.0 (cosmology)
└── Societal Progress Simulator
```

ARI governs **principles, oversight, identity, provenance, epistemic norms, and decision-making**.
It does *not* execute workflows or implement tooling.

---

# 2. Scope of ARI Governance

ARI defines and enforces the following areas:

### 2.1 Epistemic Norms
- audit-first reasoning  
- falsifiability requirements  
- metadata completeness  
- provenancing rules  
- transparency and interpretability standards  

### 2.2 Governance Structure
- role separation  
- approval boundaries  
- oversight responsibilities  
- independence of workflow execution  

### 2.3 Identity & Integrity Anchoring
- identity rules  
- attestation independence principles  
- repository identity controls  
- reproducibility guarantees  

### 2.4 Documentation & Metadata Standards
- metadata block requirements  
- artifact traceability  
- documentation versioning  
- diagram and schema rules  

### 2.5 Lifecycle Policies
- evolution of AWO  
- transition to CRI-CORE  
- integration of case studies  
- deprecation and archival behaviors

# 3. ARI is *Not*

To maintain institutional clarity:

ARI is **not**:
- a workflow  
- a codebase  
- an execution engine  
- a model  
- an experiment  
- a scientific domain framework  
- a personal blog  
- a philosophical essay collection  

ARI **does not**:
- run workflows  
- validate commits  
- provide runtime logic  
- generate artifacts  
- execute scientific simulations  

ARI **exists solely** to provide the rules, philosophy, and governance around these activities.

# 4. Architectural Components

ARI consists of five primary components:

### 4.1 Governance Model
Defines the rules, roles, separation of concerns, and approval logic that govern the initiative.

### 4.2 Epistemic Doctrine
Establishes ARI’s scientific philosophy:
- audit-first epistemology  
- reproducibility as identity  
- falsifiability as mandatory  
- deterministic provenance  

### 4.3 Institutional Interfaces
How ARI integrates with:
- AWO (method)
- CRI-CORE (tooling)
- Case studies (research)

### 4.4 Metadata & Provenance Framework
Defines:
- metadata blocks  
- documentation structure  
- artifact identity rules  
- versioning and logging processes  

### 4.5 Evolution & Roadmap
Outlines:
- transition from AWO dominance to CRI-CORE tooling  
- stability criteria  
- ecosystem expansion  
- long-term governance structure

# 5. Interaction Boundaries

### 5.1 With AWO (Method)
ARI:
- defines governance  
- enforces epistemic standards  
- sets metadata requirements  
- dictates role separation rules  

AWO:
- implements workflows  
- enforces determinism (temporary)  
- conducts scientific execution  

### 5.2 With CRI-CORE (Tooling)
ARI:
- sets expectations for determinism  
- defines provenance criteria  
- governs versioning norms  

CRI-CORE:
- implements deterministic execution logic  
- enforces identity binding  
- provides the reproducibility engine  

### 5.3 With Scientific Case Studies
ARI:
- provides epistemic rules  
- ensures falsifiability and auditability  
- defines metadata structure  

Case studies:
- apply the standards  
- generate research artifacts  
- produce domain-specific results

# 6. Stability & Maturity Phases

ARI evolves in distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Foundational Architecture  
(You are here)
- establish governance  
- create initial documents  
- define structure  

### Phase 2: Integration with AWO  
- enforce metadata rules  
- define governance boundaries  
- link ARI artifacts to AWO provenance  

### Phase 3: CRI-CORE Onboarding  
- transition enforcement from AWO to CRI  
- formalize deterministic runner requirements  

### Phase 4: Institutional Maturity  
- public documentation  
- licensing decisions  
- stability audits  
- reproducibility certification

# 7. Revisions & Amendments

All architectural changes must:
1. be logged in `logs/GOV_LOG.md`  
2. include version increments  
3. maintain backward linkage  
4. be approved through ARI governance rules  

No architectural changes may be made silently.

This document establishes the initial institutional architecture of ARI.
Future versions will add diagrams, decision logic, metadata schemas, and governance rules.
