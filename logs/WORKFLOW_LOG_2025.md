# Workflow Log — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

This log chronicles the verified development of **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**.  
Each entry corresponds to a public GitHub release tag and documented repository state.  
Format: **What I did, What I learned, Next step.**

---

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.0 Initial Public Release
- **What I did:** Published the first public release of the AWO framework. Defined core orchestration roles (Primary Engine, Supporting Models, Human-in-the-Loop). Implemented baseline reproducibility mechanisms — environment pins, logs, and deterministic runners.  
- **What I learned:** Reproducibility is not just about code; it’s a behavioral protocol. Role separation and structured critique loops are essential for credible AI-assisted research.  
- **Next step:** Prepare repository for DOI integration and archival validation.

---

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.2 Zenodo Integration & DOI Preparation
- **What I did:** Added `.zenodo.json` and `CITATION.cff` for metadata governance. Verified Zenodo webhook and minted the **concept DOI**. Updated README badges and licensing.  
- **What I learned:** Formal citation infrastructure transforms a repository from a project into an archival artifact. DOI traceability ensures provenance and accountability.  
- **Next step:** Establish audit and decision frameworks to make AWO self-governing.

---

## 2025-09-02 — v1.1.0 Audit Framework
- **What I did:** Introduced `/decisions/` with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs 0001–0010). Expanded `/logs/` for timestamped audit entries. Added audit-gate support and schemas for falsifiability, provenance, and reproducibility validation.  
- **What I learned:** Governance requires explicit structure — ADRs, manifests, and schema validation convert intent into verifiable evidence.  
- **Next step:** Harden documentation consistency and prepare the repository for long-term organizational stewardship.

---

## 2025-10-12 — v1.1.1 Repository Hardening, Organizational Transfer & Attestation Integration
- **What I did:** Completed full repository hardening and governance migration to **Waveframe Labs**.  
  Standardized all folder-level `README.md` files with metadata headers (filetype, version, updated, maintainer, contact).  
  Unified maintainer and contact identity under `swright@waveframelabs.org`.  
  Implemented **cryptographic attestation** using Sigstore `cosign` for OIDC-based signing of AWO runs.  
  Each run now produces verifiable artifacts (`ATTESTATION.txt`, `.sig`, `.cert`) linking manifests to checksums.  
  Updated GitHub workflow to include attestation generation, signature upload, and verification gates.  
  Deprecated manual `/audit/` procedures in favor of tamper-evident attestation.  
  Verified integrity through successful attested run `run_2025-10-12T14-29-03Z`.

- **What I learned:**  
  AWO has reached maturity as a fully governed, cryptographically verifiable methodology.  
  The addition of attestation bridges the last reproducibility gap—ensuring every run, manifest, and checksum is both auditable and tamper-evident.  
  Institutional transfer under **Waveframe Labs** formally establishes AWO as part of a reproducible-research ecosystem with enterprise-grade trust guarantees.

- **Next step:**  
  1. Tag **v1.1.1** and archive the attested release on Zenodo.  
  2. Begin **CRI-CORE** integration as the operational layer for continuous research verification.  
  3. Document attestation verification instructions for external replicators.

- ADR-0014 — *Repository Hardening and Organizational Transfer to Waveframe Labs*  
- ADR-0015 — *Attestation Integration & Cryptographic Signing*

## Current Status (as of 2025-10-12)
- **What I did:** Finalized **AWO v1.1.1** as a hardened, cryptographically verifiable reproducibility framework under **Waveframe Labs** governance.  
  Completed full repository audit, attestation pipeline integration, and organizational migration.  
  Verified reproducibility integrity via attested run `run_2025-10-12T14-29-03Z` and corresponding signature artifacts.

## 2025-10-19 — v1.2.0 Automated Documentation Builds & Aurora Research Initiative Finalization

- **What I did:**  
  Integrated automated PDF build pipelines for all core documentation artifacts (Whitepaper and Method Specification).  
  Implemented two GitHub Actions workflows (`build-whitepaper-pdf.yml` and `build-methodspec-pdf.yml`) to generate and commit reproducible `.pdf` outputs from Markdown sources using Pandoc + XeLaTeX.  
  Verified successful bot-committed builds of `/docs/AWO_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf` and `/docs/AWO_Method_Spec_v1.2.pdf`.  
  Transitioned institutional governance from **Waveframe Labs** to the **Aurora Research Initiative**, aligning AWO with its broader reproducibility mandate.  
  Prepared the repository for final `v1.2.0` tag and Zenodo archival once integration resumes.

- **What I learned:**  
  Automation is the final bridge between transparency and reproducibility.  
  By removing human intervention from documentation builds, AWO now guarantees verifiable parity between Markdown and distributed PDFs — every artifact can be reproduced exactly from versioned source.  
  Institutional continuity under the **Aurora Research Initiative** ensures AWO’s methodology remains transparent, citable, and evolution-ready.

- **Next step:**  
  1. Tag and publish `v1.2.0` on GitHub.  
  2. Attach generated PDFs to the release for long-term archival and Zenodo DOI linking.  
  3. Begin **CRI-CORE** phase: operationalize AWO’s orchestration logic into a continuous runtime for live epistemic verification.  

**Related ADRs:**  
- ADR-0016 — *Automated PDF Build Integration*  
- ADR-0017 — *Documentation Governance under Aurora Research Initiative*

---

## Current Status (as of 2025-10-19)
- **What I did:** Finalized AWO v1.2.0 under Aurora Research Initiative governance.  
  Established automated documentation workflows, verified build reproducibility, and validated repository readiness for archival.  
  The framework is now fully reproducible and institutionally aligned — marking AWO’s completion and handoff to the upcoming CRI-CORE operational phase.
