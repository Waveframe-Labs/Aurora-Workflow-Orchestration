# Workflow Log — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

This log documents the evolution of the **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** repository.  
Entries follow the format: **What I did, What I learned, Next step.**  
This file functions as a historical record of how AWO evolved from concept to a fully operational reproducibility framework.

---

## 2025-08-14 — v0.1.0 Initial Scaffold
- **What I did:** Created the repository scaffold with placeholder README. Early drafts referenced “Epistemic Orchestration Method (EOM)” before finalizing the title **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**.  
- **What I learned:** Dropping the epistemic label clarified the scope and made the method more accessible as a reproducibility framework.  
- **Next step:** Develop README and position AWO as a flagship orchestration methodology, with **Waveframe** as its first applied case study.

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.2 Zenodo Integration & DOI Preparation
- **What I did:** Added `.zenodo.json` and `CITATION.cff`; minted a **concept DOI** on Zenodo. Updated README badges and refined language to emphasize auditability, version control, and documentation discipline.  
- **What I learned:** DOI minting transformed AWO from a codebase into a citable, archival artifact. The project’s credibility increased once reproducibility and attribution were embedded into the workflow.  
- **Next step:** Develop the first formal **whitepaper** and design the audit framework that enforces falsifiability and schema validation.  

---

## 2025-09-04 — v1.1.0 Whitepaper + Audit Framework
- **What I did:** Added **AWO Whitepaper v1.0** in `/docs/`, along with `/decisions/` (ADRs 0001–0010). Created `/schemas/` and `/templates/` to define the reproducibility backbone. Introduced the audit-gate concept and linked workflow automation via `.github/workflows/awo-run.yml`.  
- **What I learned:** Governance requires artifacts — ADRs, manifests, and validation scripts provide the reproducibility guarantees that ordinary documentation can’t.  
- **Next step:** Expand ADR coverage, finalize the whitepaper DOI, and transition toward automated validation under the CRI-CORE pipeline.  

---

## 2025-10-07 — v1.2.0 Whitepaper Finalization & Repository Refinement
- **What I did:** Completed and published the full **AWO Whitepaper v1.0** (`/docs/AWO_Whitepaper_v1.0.md`). Integrated the **AI Governance Gap** visual. Verified Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.17013612`. Updated all references and contact information to **swright@waveframelabs.org**. Deleted outdated `/audit/` directory (manual records superseded by audit gates).  
- **What I learned:** AWO is now self-consistent — all governance artifacts, schemas, and validation mechanisms are aligned with the method spec. Manual audit folders are obsolete under the new audit-gate and schema system.  
- **Next step:** Prepare for transfer under **Waveframe Labs** organization and integrate CRI-CORE as the operational execution layer.

---

## 2025-10-08 — v1.3.0 Transition to Waveframe Labs
- **What I did:** Established the **Waveframe Labs** GitHub organization and email domain (`waveframelabs.org`). Began migrating AWO, Waveframe v4.0, and the Societal Health Simulator repositories under the shared org structure.  
- **What I learned:** Centralization under Waveframe Labs transforms AWO from a standalone method into part of a reproducible-research ecosystem. The lab structure supports continuity, DOI management, and institutional-grade governance.  
- **Next step:**  
  1. Finalize revised **README** and **CITATION.cff** under Waveframe Labs branding.  
  2. Cross-link repositories (AWO ↔ CRI-CORE ↔ Waveframe).  
  3. Draft roadmap for **CRI-CORE Enterprise** as compliance-grade reproducibility infrastructure.

---

## Current Status (as of 2025-10-08)
- **What I did:** Finalized AWO v1.3.0 as a mature, auditable framework for reproducible AI–human collaboration.  
- **What I learned:** AWO now operates as the *methodological backbone* of the Waveframe Labs ecosystem. CRI-CORE will assume the role of its automation and scaling layer.  
- **Next step:** Prepare v1.3.1 release for Zenodo archival, revise README and citation metadata, and update the changelog to reflect audit directory deprecation and organizational transfer.

*This log serves as AWO’s provenance ledger; each entry corresponds to verifiable repository states and tagged releases.*
