This log documents the evolution of the **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** repository.  
Entries follow the standard template: **What I did, What I learned, Next step.**

## 2025-08-14 — v0.1.0 Initial Scaffold
- What I did: Created repository with placeholder README; early drafts referenced “Epistemic Orchestration Method (EOM).” Locked final project name to **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**.  
- What I learned: Removing epistemic framing simplified the scope and clarified positioning.  
- Next step: Build README and position AWO as flagship, with Waveframe as first case study.

## 2025-08-31 — v1.0.2 Zenodo Integration & DOI Preparation
- What I did: Added `.zenodo.json` metadata and `CITATION.cff`. Verified Zenodo concept DOI and inserted badge. Reframed README to emphasize reproducibility and auditability.  
- What I learned: Zenodo integration ensures long-term archiving and makes AWO citable. Clarified AWO as flagship methodology with Waveframe v4.0 as first case study.  
- Next step: Prepare whitepaper and supporting audit framework.

## 2025-09-04 — v1.1.0 Whitepaper + Audit Framework
- What I did: Added **AWO Whitepaper v1.0** (`/docs/` in Markdown + PDF). Introduced `/decisions/` with ADRs. Expanded `/logs/` with timestamped entries. Updated README with links to decisions, case studies, and DOI. Clarified dual-licensing: Apache 2.0 (code) + CC BY 4.0 (docs/logs).  
- What I learned: Combining ADRs and logs formalizes auditability. Dual-licensing provides clarity between code and documentation.  
- Next step: Cross-link ADRs with dialogue log entries and expand citations (`citation.bib`).

## Current Status
- What I did: Published README, Whitepaper, ADRs, and Logs. Confirmed Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17013612](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17013612). Archived Waveframe v4.0.5 as first case study.  
- What I learned: AWO has matured from concept to fully auditable framework.  
- Next step: Backfill dialogue logs with ADR references; expand supporting evidence in citations; prepare outreach (LinkedIn, publication).
