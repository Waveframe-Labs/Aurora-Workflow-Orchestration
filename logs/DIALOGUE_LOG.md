# Dialogue Log (Curated) — AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

Purpose: capture only claim-carrying excerpts that shaped AWO; each excerpt must link to audits and/or decisions.  
Scope: conceptual input, critiques, validation, and framing from non-repo sources (LLMs, reviewers).  
Linkage: every entry lists claim IDs and references to ADRs or audits.

## Iteration 01 (2025-09-04)

**Question:** Is AWO ad-hoc, new, or scientifically valuable?  
**Claim IDs:** CLM-001, CLM-002, CLM-003

### Excerpt 1
- **Source:** External Model (LinkedIn draft support)  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-09-04  
- **Content:** Introduced five non-negotiable requirements: falsifiability, logging, independent audits, rejection loop, portability.  
- **Linked Audit:** `/logs/audits/CLM-001_requirements.md`  
- **Decision:** `/decisions/0003-audit-gates-rejection-loop.md`  
- **Result:** Adopted as AWO’s core pillars.

### Excerpt 2
- **Source:** External Model (citations file review)  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-09-04  
- **Content:** Confirmed reproducibility citations anchor AWO in real scholarship, bridging workflow systems to reasoning.  
- **Linked Audit:** `/logs/audits/CLM-002_evidence.md`  
- **Decision:** `/decisions/0002-evidence-registry-citation-policy.md`  
- **Result:** Retained evidence registry internally; reinforced credibility of AWO.

### Excerpt 3
- **Source:** Consensus AI  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-09-04  
- **Content:** Declared AWO is the opposite of ad-hoc; validates framework positioning.  
- **Linked Audit:** `/logs/audits/CLM-003_framework.md`  
- **Decision:** `/decisions/0001-flagship-vs-case-studies.md`  
- **Result:** Strengthened AWO as a methodological framework, not opportunistic usage.

---

### Excerpt 4
- **Source:** Consensus AI  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-09-04  
- **Content:** Novelty confirmed: AWO makes AI-assisted reasoning auditable and reproducible; builds on workflow managers and open science.  
- **Linked Audit:** `/logs/audits/CLM-004_novelty.md`  
- **Decision:** `/decisions/0004-logging-schema.md`  
- **Result:** Framed AWO as extending but distinct from Galaxy/Nextflow.

### Excerpt 5
- **Source:** Consensus AI  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-09-04  
- **Content:** Confirmed scientific value; mapped to reproducibility literature (Reis 2022, Goble 2020, Chirigati 2016, Amershi 2019).  
- **Linked Audit:** `/logs/audits/CLM-005_scientific-value.md`  
- **Decision:** `/decisions/0005-portability-guarantees.md`  
- **Result:** Aligned AWO with active research; tied claims to concrete citations.

## Logging Protocol
- Each new dialogue thread gets an **Iteration** entry with claim IDs.  
- Each excerpt must link to an audit and an ADR.  
- Long transcripts can be stored in `/logs/dialogue/raw/`.  
- ADRs reference DL claim IDs for traceability.

### Maintainer Note
If a dialogue influenced scope, claims, or method, it must appear here.  
No entry → no recognized impact on AWO.
