## Claim
AWO is strengthened by maintaining a non-AI-generated evidence registry that anchors the method in existing scholarship, bridging workflow systems to reasoning workflows.

---

## Criteria
- Evidence file must exist in `citations/`.  
- Citations must include reproducibility and workflow literature.  
- ADR must define policy for how evidence is logged and updated.  

---

## Evidence
- `citations/REPRODUCIBILITY_CONTEXT.md` (internal registry of reproducibility references).  
- `citations/citation.bib` (BibTeX-formatted sources).  
- `decisions/ADR-0002-evidence-registry-citation-policy.md`.  
- README “Why It Matters” section referencing reproducibility and auditability.  

---

## Result
**PASS** — Evidence registry exists, populated with non-AI references, and policy is established in ADR-0002.  

---

## Notes
- Need to expand citations coverage beyond reproducibility into auditability frameworks and human–AI collaboration literature.  
- Consider linking each requirement in the spec directly to one or more bib entries.
