## Claim
AWO requires a dedicated evidence registry containing non-AI-generated citations, anchoring the method in existing scholarship and bridging workflow systems to reasoning workflows.

---

## Rationale
- Evidence registries are standard in reproducibility-driven fields (e.g., bioinformatics).  
- External feedback confirmed that maintaining citations distinct from generative text avoids credibility pitfalls.  
- Ensures AWO can demonstrate grounding in peer-reviewed and verifiable research.  

---

## Outcome
- Claim accepted.  
- `citations/REPRODUCIBILITY_CONTEXT.md` created as the evidence registry.  
- `citations/citation.bib` added for BibTeX-formatted references.  
- Policy formalized through ADR-0002.
