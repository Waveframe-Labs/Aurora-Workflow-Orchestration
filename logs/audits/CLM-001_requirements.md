# Audit Report — CLM-001 (Core Requirements Definition)

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Source**: External model feedback (LinkedIn draft prompt → method pillars)  
**Auditor**: Main Model (validated against external critique)

## Claim
AWO must operationalize five non-negotiable requirements:  
1. Falsifiability — every claim gets a test.  
2. Logging — dialogue and decisions are recorded.  
3. Independent audits — separate models/reviewers validate outputs.  
4. Rejection loop — failed audits force revision or withdrawal.  
5. Portability — method must be template-driven and repo-agnostic.  

---

## Rationale
- Derived from dialogue log entry (DL-2025-09-04-001).  
- Mirrors reproducibility standards in workflow management systems (Nextflow, Galaxy).  
- Adds auditability and portability as extensions specific to AI-assisted reasoning.

---

## Outcome
- Claim accepted.  
- Incorporated into `docs/AWO_Method_Spec_v1.1.md` (Sections 2–3).  
- Templates (`falsifiability-manifest.md`, `audit-checklist.md`, `worklog-entry.md`) created to enforce requirements.
