**Reviewer:** User

## Claim
AWO is defined by five non-negotiable requirements:
1. Falsifiability  
2. Logging  
3. Independent audits  
4. Rejection loop  
5. Portability  

---

## Criteria
- Each requirement must appear explicitly in the method specification.  
- Templates must exist to enforce each requirement.  
- Release checklist must verify compliance with all five.  

---

## Evidence
- `docs/AWO_Method_Spec_v1.1.md` (Sections 2–3 list the five requirements).  
- `templates/falsifiability-manifest.md` (claim IDs, tests).  
- `logs/README.md` (logging schema).  
- `templates/audit-checklist.md` (independent audits).  
- `templates/worklog-entry.md` + `decisions/ADR-0003.md` (rejection loop).  
- `templates/awo.config.yaml` (portability).  
- `templates/release-checklist.md` (ensures all five requirements are tested).  

---

## Result
**PASS** — All five requirements are explicitly defined and backed by artifacts.  

---

## Notes
- Need to ensure future ADRs continue linking new features back to one of the five requirements.  
- Consider adding cross-references from the README “In-Repo Guarantees” section directly to these files for clarity.
