# Audit Report — CLM-003 (Framework Validation)

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Source**: Consensus AI (third-party feedback on README)  
**Auditor**: Main Model (validated against external critique)  

---

## Claim
AWO is not ad-hoc AI usage; it is a structured methodological framework designed for reproducibility, falsifiability, and auditability.

---

## Rationale
- External validation confirmed that AWO’s reproducibility scaffolding (logs, ADRs, templates) distinguish it from ad-hoc use.  
- README explicitly frames AWO as a **framework** with falsifiability and auditability at its core.  
- Establishing AWO as a framework strengthens its scientific credibility and portability across case studies.  

---

## Outcome
- Claim accepted.  
- README retained “framework” positioning.  
- ADR-0001 finalized to record flagship positioning (AWO vs. case studies).
