# Workflow Log – AI Orchestration Method (AOM)

This log documents the factual sequence of steps taken to establish the **AI Orchestration Method (AOM)** as the flagship repository.  
It tracks naming decisions, README development, file generation, and supporting artifacts.

## Timeline of Events

**1. Naming Clarification**  
- Initial draft README included “Epistemic Orchestration Method (EOM)” alongside “AI-Workflow-Orchestration.”  
- User decided to remove epistemic naming entirely.  
- Official project name locked to **AI Orchestration Method (AOM)**.  

---

**2. Flagship Positioning**  
- External commentary (shared by user) suggested that Waveframe was only a testbed and the orchestration method itself was the true innovation.  
- Assistant agreed, concluding:  
  - AOM = flagship repository.  
  - Waveframe = first case study.  
  - Future case studies (e.g., customer review analysis) will validate generality.  

---

**3. README Development**  
- User provided strong draft README with badges, banner, plain-language intro, rationale, and repo structure.  
- Assistant recommended recalibration:  
  - Remove all references to EOM.  
  - Emphasize reproducibility, human-in-the-loop oversight, and business applications.  
  - Maintain academic credibility while adding recruiter-safe framing.  
- Full README rewritten as **AOM-only**, positioning it as the crown jewel.  

---

**4. README Export**  
- Assistant generated the revised README as a downloadable `README.md` file.  
- File included complete structure with Overview, Why It Matters, Skills, Deliverables, Workflow Cycle, Roles, Repo Layout, Case Studies, Principles, and Citation.  

---

**5. Supporting Sections**  
- User requested dedicated **Author** and **License** sections.  
- Assistant generated Markdown for both, ready to append to README.  

---

**6. Dialogue and Workflow Logs**  
- User requested a curated dialogue log from this thread.  
- Initial attempt was summary-like; user clarified that actual excerpts belong in the dialogue log.  
- Assistant revised `DIALOGUE_LOG.md` with curated excerpts.  
- User confirmed the distinction and requested this file, `WORKFLOW_LOG.md`, as the factual counterpart.  

---

## Current Status

- **README.md** complete and positioned as flagship.  
- **Author** and **License** sections generated.  
- **DIALOGUE_LOG.md** complete with curated excerpts.  
- **WORKFLOW_LOG.md** (this file) complete with factual timeline.  

AOM is formally established as the crown jewel repository, with Waveframe and other projects serving as case studies.
