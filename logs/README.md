# Logs — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

**Purpose**  
This directory stores official workflow and provenance logs for Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO).  
Logs capture the project’s chronological evolution, including structural changes, governance decisions, and release milestones — providing an immutable record of how the framework developed and matured.

---

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **WORKFLOW_LOG.md** | Primary development log tracking the repository’s progression from concept to reproducible framework. Each entry documents *what was done, what was learned, and next steps* using timestamped release milestones. |

---

## Log Policy

- All updates to the repository or governance structure must be reflected in `WORKFLOW_LOG.md`.  
- Each new section should correspond to a **semantic version update** or major methodological milestone.  
- Edits are additive only — prior entries must never be altered or rewritten.  
- All log entries must include:  
  - Date and version identifier  
  - Summary of actions taken  
  - Key lessons or insights  
  - Planned next steps  

This ensures the log functions as a verifiable **provenance ledger**, consistent with AWO’s reproducibility standard.

---

## Integration & Archival

- Each log update is automatically linked to version tags and Zenodo DOIs during archival.  
- The log supplements `/decisions/` (ADRs) by providing narrative context to design choices.  
- During **audit-gate** validation, log entries are checked for correspondence with repository diffs and ADR indices.
