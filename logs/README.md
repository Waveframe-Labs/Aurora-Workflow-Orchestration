# Logs — Structure and Expectations

- **/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — daily/cluster work entries (what I did, learned, next, skills).
- **/logs/dialogue/** — curated excerpts that carry claims or decisions; link to ADRs and the Falsifiability Manifest.
- **/logs/audits/** — optional per-claim audit notes (logic/data/peer). Keep short and link to evidence.

Minimum per iteration: one work log entry, at least one audit record for changed claims, and links to evidence.
