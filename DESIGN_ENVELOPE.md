# AWO v2 — Design Envelope (Minimal)
Scope: Aurora Workflow Orchestration (L1 — Method Layer)

---

## 1. Purpose

Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) defines the **methodological layer** of the Aurora Ecosystem.

Its purpose is to **structure, record, and standardize governed reasoning workflows** so that work performed under higher-order epistemic and governance constraints can be:

- reconstructed,
- audited,
- validated downstream,
- and preserved over time.

AWO exists to make *how* work was done explicit — not to judge whether it was correct, legitimate, or approved.

---

## 2. Layer Position & Authority

AWO operates exclusively at **L1 (Method / Operational Semantics)**.

- Governance authority is defined by **ARI / NTD / NTS (L0)**.
- Validation and enforcement are performed by **CRI-CORE (L4)**.
- Publication and distribution are handled by **Forge / Stamp (L5)**.

AWO **implements process under upstream authority** and **produces artifacts for downstream evaluation**.

AWO does not and must not define legitimacy, truth, authority, or enforcement outcomes.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Goals

AWO explicitly does **not**:

- define epistemic legitimacy or truth
- assign or evaluate authority
- approve, reject, or attest claims
- enforce compliance or validation rules
- resolve disputes or conflicts
- score contributors or reputation
- perform audits
- execute workflows
- encode ideology or normative values

All such functions belong to other layers and may only interface with AWO through declared contracts.

---

## 4. What AWO Produces

AWO produces **method artifacts (structural records)**, including:

- workflow phase definitions
- artifact classes and structural schemas
- required metadata fields (referential to NTS)
- provenance recording structures
- phase transition rules
- methodological invariants

All AWO outputs are **descriptive** and **non-authoritative**.

---

## 5. Dependencies & Interfaces

### Upstream Dependencies
AWO depends on:

- **ARI** — for governance authority
- **NTS** — for metadata and disclosure requirements

AWO references these systems but does not redefine or enforce them.

### Downstream Interfaces
AWO produces artifacts intended for:

- **CRI-CORE** — validation and enforcement
- **Forge / Stamp** — publication and freezing

AWO must remain internally coherent and meaningful **even if downstream systems do not exist**.

---

## 6. Language & Scope Constraints

To preserve layer integrity, AWO documentation and artifacts must adhere to the following constraints:

### Forbidden Language
AWO must not use terms implying authority or enforcement, including:

- govern / governs / governance (when referring to AWO)
- authorize / authorization
- legitimate / legitimacy
- enforce / enforcement
- approve / reject
- validate (as an action performed by AWO)

### Required Framing
AWO may use terms such as:

- specifies
- structures
- records
- declares
- requires (structurally, not normatively)
- produces
- describes

---

## 7. Contract Philosophy

AWO contracts define **expected structure and method semantics**, not outcomes.

- Contracts express **what must be present**, not **what must happen**
- Violations are **detectable**, not resolved by AWO
- Enforcement responsibility lies entirely outside the method layer

---

## 8. Design Principle

AWO enforces **epistemic responsibility**, not epistemic correctness.

The role of AWO is to ensure that reasoning is:
- traceable,
- reconstructible,
- and structurally legible,

so that legitimacy and correctness can be assessed by appropriate authority layers.
