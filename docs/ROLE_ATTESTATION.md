# Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) — Role–Artifact Attestation Summary

---

## 1. Overview
This document provides the canonical **Role–Artifact Attestation Matrix** for all required AWO artifacts under version **1.2.1**.  
It establishes verified attribution between origin roles and verifying roles for each artifact type and confirms compliance with:
- **ADR-0012** — Human-in-Loop Validation  
- **ADR-0015** — Attestation Integration & Cryptographic Signing  
- **§1.6 (Method Spec)** — Principle of Neurotransparency

## 3. Attestation Summary

All required artifacts have been reviewed for:
- Correct **role attribution**
- Presence of **neurotransparency evidence** (traceable inference links)

**Result:** ✅ Fully Verified  
**Chain of Custody:** Closed and reconciled for all recorded artifacts.
