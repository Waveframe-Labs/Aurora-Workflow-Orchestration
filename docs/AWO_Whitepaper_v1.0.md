## Abstract

The **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** framework defines a reproducible governance system for AI–human collaboration. It formalizes falsifiability, auditability, and provenance within iterative research cycles. AWO enforces role separation, schema validation, and standardized decision records (ADRs) to make AI-driven work transparent and inspectable. Its operational layer, **CRI-CORE** (Continuous Research Integration), extends this methodology into automation—rendering every run reproducible, logged, and citable.

## 1. Background and motivation

AI’s rapid adoption has exposed a reproducibility and provenance crisis. AWO provides structured version control, audit trails, and verification for AI-assisted inquiry. It is a **methodological framework** rather than a package: structuring how humans and models co-orchestrate reproducible, auditable outputs.

---

## 2. Problem statement and objectives

**Weaknesses:** reproducibility gap, provenance crisis, audit opacity.  
**Objectives:** formalize falsifiability, enforce schema-validated traceability, democratize reproducibility outside institutions.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Workflow cycle

Define → Orchestrate → Validate → Document → Synthesize.  
Each cycle moves from hypothesis → orchestration → audit → artifact.

### 3.2 Roles

**Orchestrator:** scope + falsifiability.  
**Implementer:** raw outputs.  
**Refiner:** clarity + efficiency.  
**Critic:** adversarial validation.

### 3.3 Artifacts

Run manifest, claim schema, provenance schema, falsifiability manifest, audit record, ADRs, release checklist, logs.

### 3.4 Governance mechanisms

Sequential ADRs codify methodological decisions (ADR-0001–0013).  
Audit gates enforce schema validation, human approval, and logged critique before merge.

### 3.5 Tooling

`awo_run.py`, `validate_run.py`, `.github/workflows/awo-run.yml`, `/schemas/*.json`, `/templates/*.md`, `/logs/`.

### 3.6 Artifact and Governance Maps

Artifacts define reproducibility guarantees; ADRs define governance structure through release, audit, and future meta-governance (ADR-0011–0013).

### 3.7 Reproducibility verification

Schema validation, SHA-256 hashing, and environment capture ensure traceable, self-verifying runs.

## 4. Related work

AWO extends **FAIR** principles to full workflows, mirrors **CI/CD** logic through continuous research validation, and generalizes **MLFlow/DVC** rigor via governance instead of toolkits.

---

## 5. Governance framework

ADRs define evidence registry (ADR-0002), audit gates (ADR-0003), release governance (ADR-0010), human sign-off (ADR-0012), and audit expansion (ADR-0013).

---

## 6. Limitations and mitigations

1. Minimal automation → mitigated by CRI-CORE.  
2. Human oversight friction → mitigated by standardized templates.  
3. Limited case studies → mitigated by roadmap expansion.

---

## 7. Roadmap

Near-term: finalize whitepaper and release v1.0.  
Medium-term: new case studies and CRI-CORE public repo.  
Long-term: AWO as *minimum viable paper*—a reproducible unit of knowledge.

---

## 8. Conclusion

AWO proves reproducibility in AI–human collaboration is practical. It merges ADRs, schemas, and logs into a verifiable framework, while CRI-CORE operationalizes it for scale.
