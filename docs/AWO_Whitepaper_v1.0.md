## Abstract

The **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** framework defines a reproducible governance system for AI–human collaboration. It formalizes falsifiability, auditability, and provenance within iterative research cycles. AWO enforces role separation, schema validation, and standardized decision records (ADRs) to make AI-driven work transparent and inspectable. Its operational layer, **CRI-CORE** (Continuous Research Integration), extends this methodology into automation — rendering every run reproducible, logged, and citable.

---

## 1  Background and motivation

AI’s rapid adoption has exposed a reproducibility and provenance crisis.  
AWO provides structured version control, audit trails, and verification for AI-assisted inquiry. It is a **methodological framework** rather than a software package: structuring how humans and models co-orchestrate reproducible, auditable outputs.

**Maintained by Waveframe Labs** under the Aurora Research Initiative, AWO anchors independent research to transparent, citable workflows that can withstand institutional scrutiny.

---

## 2  Problem statement and objectives

**Weaknesses:** reproducibility gap, provenance crisis, audit opacity.  
**Objectives:** formalize falsifiability, enforce schema-validated traceability, democratize reproducibility outside traditional institutions.

---

## 2.5  Conceptual foundations

AI-assisted work expands human capability while obscuring epistemic accountability. Traditional science depends on explicit method and implicit trust; in AI-mediated inquiry that trust collapses. Models generate plausible results without revealing reasoning, distributing cognition across hybrid human–machine systems.

**AWO reframes reproducibility as a structural property, not a behavioral one.**  
It embeds verification directly into the workflow via manifests, audits, and decision records that make each claim falsifiable and traceable to origin.

Each stage of inquiry becomes a contract between intent and execution, hypothesis and evidence, automation and accountability.  
By encoding falsifiability and auditability within the process itself, AWO converts reproducibility from a retrospective check into an active, continuous property of research.

## 3  Methodology

### 3.1  Workflow cycle  
Define → Orchestrate → Validate → Document → Synthesize.  
Each cycle moves hypothesis → orchestration → audit → artifact.

### 3.2  Roles  
**Orchestrator:** sets scope and falsifiability.  
**Implementer:** produces raw outputs.  
**Refiner:** improves clarity and efficiency.  
**Critic:** performs adversarial validation.

### 3.3  Artifacts  
Run manifest · claim schema · provenance schema · falsifiability manifest · audit record · ADRs · release checklist · logs.

### 3.4  Governance mechanisms  
Sequential ADRs (0001–0013) codify methodological decisions.  
Audit gates require schema validation, human approval, and logged critique before merge.

### 3.5  Tooling  
`awo_run.py` · `validate_run.py` · `.github/workflows/awo-run.yml` · `/schemas/*.json` · `/templates/*.md` · `/logs/`.

### 3.6  Artifact and governance maps  
Artifacts guarantee reproducibility; ADRs define governance—release, audit, and meta-governance (ADR 0011–0013).

### 3.7  Reproducibility verification  
Schema validation, SHA-256 hashing, and environment capture ensure traceable, self-verifying runs.

## 4  Related work

AWO extends the **FAIR Principles** to full workflows, mirrors **CI/CD** logic via continuous research validation, and generalizes the rigor of **MLFlow**, **Weights & Biases**, and **DVC** through governance rather than tooling.

---

## 5  Governance framework

ADRs define:  
 • Evidence registry (ADR-0002)  
 • Audit gates (ADR-0003)  
 • Release governance (ADR-0010)  
 • Human sign-off (ADR-0012)  
 • Audit expansion (ADR-0013)

These records form a living constitution for reproducibility, updated through formal pull requests and versioned decision history.

## 6  Limitations and mitigations

1. Minimal automation → addressed by CRI-CORE.  
2. Human oversight friction → reduced through standardized templates and checklists.  
3. Limited case studies → expanded via the AWO roadmap and Waveframe Labs collaborations.

Each limitation is tracked through open ADRs and targeted in CRI-CORE milestones.

## 7  Roadmap

# Strategic Horizon

AWO now stands as a stable methodological framework. Future development will focus on integration, scalability, and institutional adoption.   
	•	Integration with CRI-CORE (Continuous Research Integration):
Extend AWO’s governance layer into a full execution environment that automates validation, archival, and reproducibility checks across projects.  
	•	Expansion through Waveframe Labs:
Establish Waveframe Labs as the organizational backbone for open, reproducible AI research — hosting AWO, CRI-CORE, and applied case studies under one ecosystem.  
	•	CRI-CORE Enterprise (planned):
Explore a deployable variant of the CRI-CORE platform designed for organizations requiring compliance-grade reproducibility, audit logging, and research traceability.  
	•	Ecosystem growth:
Encourage adoption of AWO-based templates and governance standards across scientific, technical, and creative research domains.
Promote the concept of the “minimum viable paper” — a modular, auditable unit of published knowledge.

# Summary

AWO defines the method.
CRI-CORE operationalizes it.
Waveframe Labs ensures continuity, stewardship, and scale.

---

## 8  Conclusion

AWO demonstrates that reproducibility in AI–human collaboration is achievable today.  
It fuses ADRs, schemas, and logs into a verifiable framework, while CRI-CORE operationalizes it for scalable execution and continuous research integration.
