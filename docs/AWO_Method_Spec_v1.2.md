## Abstract
Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) defines a structured, audit-first methodology for AI-assisted research.
It establishes deterministic roles, reproducible artifacts, and falsifiability gates to ensure transparent scientific progress.
This release (v1.2.0) finalizes automation for documentation builds and institutional alignment **within Waveframe Labsâ€™ Aurora Research Initiative**,
establishing the foundation for **CRI-CORE**, the runtime layer that operationalizes continuous research verification.

**Keywords:** reproducible research, AI orchestration, falsifiability, provenance, audit automation

### Purpose
Define a **repeatable, falsifiable, and auditable** methodology for AI-assisted research and analysis such that any independent party can reproduce both the process and the evidence supporting its outcomes.

### Figure 1 â€” AWOâ€“CRI-CORE Relationship

![Figure 1: AWOâ€“CRI-CORE Relationship](../figures/awo_architecture_diagram.png)

AWO defines the **methodological layer**â€”roles, artifacts, and falsifiability.  
CRI-CORE implements the **operational layer**, handling deterministic execution, provenance capture, and attestation.  
Together they form a continuous epistemic verification stack.

---

## Scope
AWO governs the structure of AI-assisted research into falsifiable claims, audited iterations, and immutable, citable releases.  
It defines the **methodological layer** that enforces reproducibility and auditability.  
**CRI-CORE** provides one possible **implementation layer** automating AWO-compliant runs and manifests, but AWO remains valid independently of it.

---

## Normative Requirements

1. **Falsifiability** â€” Every claim MUST define a testable procedure that could falsify it.  
2. **Full Logging** â€” Every reasoning step MUST be timestamped and schema-validated when applicable.  
3. **Independent Audit** â€” Logic, data, and peer reviews MUST be performed by separate agents or processes.  
4. **Rejection Loop** â€” Failed audits MUST trigger revision or withdrawal, not defense.  
5. **Portability** â€” Artifacts SHOULD be domain-agnostic and reusable across contexts.  
6. **Version Locking** â€” All claims and outputs MUST reference immutable identifiers (tags, hashes, DOIs).

---

## Roles

- **Orchestrator (Human)** â€” Frames questions, defines falsifiability criteria, resolves conflicts, approves releases.  
- **Main Model (Continuity)** â€” Maintains project context, synthesizes results, integrates audit feedback.  
- **Auxiliary Auditors (Independent)** â€”  
  - *Logic Auditor* â€” Validates reasoning consistency.  
  - *Data Validator* â€” Empirically tests claims.  
  - *Peer Critic* â€” Conducts adversarial conceptual review.  
- **System Auditor (Optional)** â€” Verifies runtime integrity and provenance (e.g., CRI-CORE logs).

---

## Core Artifacts

- **Falsifiability Manifest** (`/docs/FALSIFIABILITY_MANIFEST.md`) â€” claim IDs, tests, datasets, thresholds, status.  
- **Workflow Logs** (`/logs/*.md`) â€” dated entries with actions, insights, next steps, skills.  
- **Decision Records (ADRs)** (`/decisions/*.md`) â€” context, decision, consequences, evidence links.  
- **Evidence Registry** â€” actual repo folders:  
  - `/figures/` â€” images/plots referenced by ADRs.  
  - `/models/` â€” optional saved model artifacts.  
  - `/scripts/` â€” helper scripts used in iterations.  
  - `/workflows/` â€” executable workflow specs.  
  - `/schemas/` â€” validation and reproducibility schemas.  
- **Run Manifests** (`/runs/run_*/run_manifest.json`) â€” canonical runtime records.  
- **Attestation & Sums** (`/runs/run_*/ATTESTATION.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `.sig`, `.cert`) â€” cryptographic proof and checksums.  
- **Release Artifacts** â€” `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`, Git tag, Zenodo DOIs.

> *Note:* This specification intentionally omits `/notebooks` and `/data` because they are not present in this repository.  
> If future projects require them, add explicitly and document via ADRs and Manifests.

## Lifecycle (One Iteration)

0. **Setup** â€” Define claims, initialize Manifest, assign auditors.  
1. **Draft (Main Model)** â€” Produce reasoning and outputs tagged with claim IDs.  
2. **Audit (Independent)** â€” Logic, data, peer auditors record pass/fail results.  
3. **Synthesis (Main Model)** â€” Reconcile audits, revise claims or methods.  
4. **Decision** â€” Record outcome in ADR (accepted / revised / withdrawn).  
5. **Evidence Capture** â€” Save figures, scripts, models; update Manifest status.  
6. **Release Gate** â€” Validate reproducibility, verify attestations, confirm cross-refs, tag release, archive on Zenodo.

---

## Logging Schema

- **Log Entry:** date, action, lesson, next step, skills.  
- **Audit Record:** claim ID, auditor, check type (logic | data | peer), criteria, result, evidence links.

All logs SHOULD conform to JSON schemas under `/schemas/` when available.  
Schema version SHOULD match the repository release tag (e.g., v1.2).

---

## Rejection Handling

Any failed audit â†’ revise draft or withdraw claim.  
Partial failures â†’ enter **conditional revision** state until all criteria pass.  
Update Manifest and ADR accordingly. No appeals without new evidence.

---

## Portability Guidelines

- Keep templates generic; avoid domain jargon.  
- Parameterize datasets and metrics in Manifest only if they exist in repo.  
- Use Model Roster to swap models or auditors without changing process.  
- Derived projects (e.g., CRI-CORE or domain forks) MUST preserve schema compatibility.

---

## Conformance Checklist

- [ ] Manifest exists with â‰¥1 falsifiable claim and test.  
- [ ] Logs present for each iteration (draft â†’ audit â†’ synthesis â†’ decision).  
- [ ] â‰¥1 ADR captures a non-trivial decision or trade-off.  
- [ ] Release artifacts present; latest tag archived with Concept + Version DOIs.  
- [ ] Attestation artifacts verifiable (`ATTESTATION.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, signatures).  
- [ ] (If schemas present) Validation passed for logs and manifests.
