## Abstract
Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) defines a structured, audit-first methodology for AI-assisted research.  
It establishes deterministic roles, reproducible artifacts, and falsifiability gates to ensure transparent scientific progress.  
This release (v1.2.0) finalizes automation for documentation builds and institutional alignment under Waveframe Labsâ€™ Aurora Research Initiative,  
setting the foundation for the CRI-CORE runtime layer that operationalizes continuous research verification.

**Keywords:** reproducible research, AI orchestration, falsifiability, provenance, audit automation

### Purpose  
Define a **repeatable, falsifiable, and auditable** method for AIâ€‘assisted research and analysis so that a third party can independently reproduce both the process and the evidence supporting its outcomes.

### Figure 1. AWOâ€“CRI-CORE Relationship

![Figure 1: AWOâ€“CRI-CORE Relationship](../figures/awo_architecture_diagram.png)

AWO defines the **methodological layer**â€”roles, artifacts, and falsifiability.  
CRI-CORE implements the **operational layer**, handling deterministic execution, provenance capture, and attestation.  
Together they form a continuous epistemic verification stack.

## Scope  
AWO governs how to structure AIâ€‘assisted research into falsifiable claims, audited iterations, and immutable, citable releases.  

AWO defines the **methodological layer** that enforces reproducibility and auditability.  
**CRIâ€‘CORE** provides one possible **implementation layer** that automates AWOâ€‘compliant runs and manifests, but AWO remains valid without it.

---

## Normative Requirements (must / should)

1. **Falsifiability** â€” Every claim MUST have a defined procedure that could falsify it.  
2. **Full Logging** â€” Every reasoning step and output MUST be logged with timestamps and (when provided) schema validation.  
3. **Independent Audit** â€” Logic, data, and peer audits MUST be performed by separate agents or processes.  
4. **Rejection Loop** â€” Failed audits MUST trigger revision or withdrawal, not defense.  
5. **Portability** â€” Artifacts SHOULD be domainâ€‘agnostic and reusable across contexts.  
6. **Version Locking** â€” All claims and outputs MUST reference immutable version identifiers (tags, hashes, DOIs).  

---

## Roles  

- **Orchestrator (Human)** â€” Frames questions, defines falsifiability criteria, resolves conflicts, and approves releases.  
- **Main Model (Continuity)** â€” Maintains project context, synthesizes results, and integrates audit feedback.  
- **Auxiliary Auditors (Independent)** â€”  
  - *Logic Auditor* â€” Ensures internal consistency and valid reasoning.  
  - *Data Validator* â€” Tests claims empirically.  
  - *Peer Critic* â€” Performs adversarial review to surface conceptual errors.  
- **System Auditor (Optional)** â€” Verifies runtime integrity and provenance (e.g., CRIâ€‘CORE execution logs).  

---

## Core Artifacts (per repository)

- **Falsifiability Manifest** (`/docs/FALSIFIABILITY_MANIFEST.md`) â€” claim IDs, tests, datasets (if any), thresholds, and status.  
- **Workflow Logs** (`/logs/*.md`) â€” dated entries with actions, insights, next steps, skills.  
- **Decision Records (ADRs)** (`/decisions/*.md`) â€” context, decision, consequences, and evidence links.  
- **Evidence Registry** â€” **use actual folders present in this repo**:  
  - `/figures/` â€” images/plots referenced by manifests and ADRs.  
  - `/models/` â€” optional saved model artifacts (if produced).  
  - `/scripts/` â€” helper scripts used during an iteration (referenced from ADRs).  
  - `/workflows/` â€” executable workflow specifications used during runs.  
  - `/schemas/` â€” validation and reproducibility schemas.  
- **Run Manifests** (`/runs/run_*/run_manifest.json`) â€” canonical record of runtime state and results for AWOâ€‘compliant executions.  
- **Attestation & Sums** (`/runs/run_*/ATTESTATION.txt`, `/runs/run_*/SHA256SUMS.txt`, plus `.sig`/`.cert`) â€” cryptographic proof and checksums for each run.  
- **Release Artifacts** â€” `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`, Git tag, and Zenodo DOIs (concept + version).  

> **Note:** This specification intentionally does **not** reference `/notebooks` or `/data`, because those folders are **not present** in this repository. If future projects need them, add explicitly and update ADRs/manifests accordingly; the AWO method itself does not require them.

## Lifecycle (one iteration)

0. **Setup** â€” Define claims, initialize Falsifiability Manifest, prepare `/templates`, assign auditors via Model Roster.  
1. **Draft (Main Model)** â€” Produce reasoning and outputs tagged with claim IDs.  
2. **Audit (Independent)** â€” Logic, data, and peer auditors record pass/fail results and notes.  
3. **Synthesis (Main Model)** â€” Reconcile audit outputs; revise claims or methods.  
4. **Decision** â€” Record outcome in ADR (accepted / revised / withdrawn) with evidence links.  
5. **Evidence Capture** â€” Save figures and scripts, capture any produced models, and update Manifest status.  
6. **Release Gate** â€” Validate reproducibility (schema if present, e.g., `/schemas/run.schema.json`); verify attestation and checksums (`ATTESTATION.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, signatures); confirm crossâ€‘references; tag release and archive on Zenodo.  

---

## Logging Schema (minimum fields)

- **Log Entry:** date, action, lesson, next step, skills.  
- **Audit Record:** claim ID, auditor, check type (logic | data | peer), criteria, result, evidence links.  

All logs SHOULD conform to JSON schemas under `/schemas/` when available.  
Schema version SHOULD match the repository release tag (e.g., v1.2).

---

## Rejection Handling  

Any failed audit â†’ revise draft or withdraw claim.  
Partial failures â†’ enter **conditional revision** state until all criteria pass.  
Update Manifest and ADR accordingly. No appeals without new evidence.  

---

## Portability Guidelines  

- Keep templates generic; avoid domain jargon in checklists.  
- Parameterize datasets and metrics in the Manifest **only if they exist** in the repo.  
- Use the Model Roster to swap models or auditors without changing the process.  
- Derived projects (e.g., CRIâ€‘CORE or domain forks) MUST preserve fieldâ€‘level schema compatibility.  

---

## Conformance Checklist  

- [ ] Manifest exists with at least one falsifiable claim and test.  
- [ ] Logs present for each iteration (draft â†’ audit â†’ synthesis â†’ decision).  
- [ ] At least one ADR captures a nonâ€‘trivial tradeâ€‘off or decision.  
- [ ] Release artifacts present; latest tag archived with Concept + Version DOIs.  
- [ ] Attestation artifacts present and verifiable (`ATTESTATION.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, signatures).  
- [ ] (If schemas present) Schema validation passed for logs and manifests.
