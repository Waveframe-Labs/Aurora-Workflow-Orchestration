# Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) — Governance Summary

---

## 1. Purpose
This document consolidates all **attestation, audit, and oversight activities** performed under the **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** standard.  
It functions as the human-readable summary of repository governance, linking together:
- Compliance certifications  
- Governance log records  
- Attestation and checksum verifications  
- Role validations and archival continuity  

All entries correspond to immutable log or ADR references verified through `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
