# Waveframe Labs: Frequently Asked Questions

---

### Wait, is this a real lab?



---

### Do I need to use AWO?


---

### Do I need to set up CI?



---

### What is a falsifiability manifest?


---

### What counts as a valid run?



---

### Can I just fork this and run it privately?

Absolutely. Everything’s open source.  
But don’t say you’re “using AWO” unless you’re actually meeting the method spec. We will notice.

---

### Who reviews contributions?

Other contributors take on roles:  
- **Critic** to question assumptions  
- **Signer** to verify method adherence  
- **Maintainer** to merge once all roles are satisfied

If you want to lurk and learn, become an Observer.

### I don’t have a research question yet.


---

### Who is behind this?


---

### I found a bug in CRI-CORE or a method issue. Now what?



If you’re right, we’ll add a fix and cite you in the changelog.
