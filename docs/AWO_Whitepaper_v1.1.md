# Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO): Framework for Reproducible AI–Human Collaboration

## Abstract
The **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** framework defines a reproducible, audit-first governance system for AI–human collaboration.  
It formalizes falsifiability, provenance, and attestation within iterative research cycles, transforming scientific work from ad-hoc experimentation into a verifiable process.  
This release (v1.1.0) finalizes automation for documentation builds and establishes institutional alignment within **Waveframe Labs’ Aurora Research Initiative**, setting the foundation for **CRI-CORE**—the runtime layer that operationalizes continuous research verification.

**Keywords:** reproducibility, AI orchestration, falsifiability, provenance, audit automation

## 1. Introduction
Scientific collaboration between humans and AI demands structure. The **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** method provides that structure through deterministic, falsifiable, and auditable research cycles.  
Unlike conventional “prompt-and-respond” workflows, AWO defines a reproducibility protocol that ensures each step of reasoning, audit, and synthesis can be independently verified.  

AWO exists as part of the **Aurora Research Initiative**, a Waveframe Labs program advancing open, falsifiable science through independent governance. Companion projects include **Waveframe v4.0 (cosmology)** and the **Societal Progress Simulator**—each built using AWO as the foundational methodology.

---

## 2. Method Overview
AWO provides the **methodological layer** for reproducible AI-human research.  
**CRI-CORE** serves as the **operational layer**, automating AWO-compliant runs and verifications.  
This separation ensures AWO remains implementation-agnostic—valid with or without CRI-CORE.

Each AWO iteration follows a reproducible pattern:

1. Define falsifiable claims.  
2. Assign roles (human + AI).  
3. Execute and log reasoning.  
4. Conduct independent audits.  
5. Capture evidence.  
6. Validate, tag, and archive.

Artifacts such as `run_manifest.json`, workflow logs, and cryptographic attestations form the canonical research record.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **Orchestrator (Human)** | Frames questions, defines falsifiability criteria, resolves conflicts, and approves releases. |
| **Main Model (Continuity)** | Maintains project context, synthesizes reasoning, and integrates audit feedback. |
| **Auxiliary Auditors (Independent)** | Logic, data, and peer auditors evaluate consistency, validity, and conceptual rigor. |
| **System Auditor (Optional)** | Validates runtime provenance through CRI-CORE logs, checksums, and attestations. |

These formal designations replace earlier informal “Implementer / Refiner / Critic” roles, ensuring alignment with **AWO_Method_Spec_v1.2**.

---

## 4. Core Artifacts
Each AWO repository must contain:

- **Falsifiability Manifest** (`/docs/falsifiability-manifest.md`) — claim IDs, tests, thresholds, and audit status.  
- **Run Manifest** (`/runs/run_*/run_manifest.json`) — canonical record of execution.  
- **Schemas** (`/schemas/*.json`) — validate manifests and logs.  
- **Decision Records (ADRs)** (`/decisions/*.md`) — document trade-offs and rationale.  
- **Logs** (`/logs/*.md`) — record draft, audit, synthesis, and outcome.  
- **Attestations & Checksums** (`ATTESTATION.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `.sig`, `.cert`) — verify integrity and provenance.  
- **Release Artifacts** — `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`, version tags, and DOIs.  

> *Note:* No `/notebooks` or `/data` directories are required unless explicitly declared and governed by ADRs.

---

## 5. Lifecycle
AWO follows a falsifiability-driven lifecycle:

1. **Setup** — Define claims, initialize manifests, assign auditors.  
2. **Draft** — Generate reasoning and initial outputs.  
3. **Audit** — Perform independent logic, data, and peer reviews.  
4. **Synthesis** — Integrate audit findings; revise claims or methods.  
5. **Decision** — Record results in ADRs.  
6. **Evidence Capture** — Save figures, manifests, and logs.  
7. **Release Gate** — Validate checksums and attestations; archive via Zenodo.

CRI-CORE automates steps 3–7, ensuring deterministic replication and machine-verified validation.

---

## 6. Integration Note — CRI-CORE
**CRI-CORE** operationalizes AWO principles in runtime.  
It manages provenance, execution, and immutability of research runs by:

- Capturing `run_manifest.json` for each execution.  
- Generating verifiable attestations and SHA-256 checksums.  
- Enforcing deterministic replay.  
- Maintaining immutable audit trails under `/runs/`.

This separation ensures that methodology (AWO) remains independent of implementation (CRI-CORE).

---

## 7. Governance and Licensing
AWO is maintained by **Waveframe Labs** under the **Aurora Research Initiative**.  
Text content is released under **CC BY 4.0** and code under **Apache-2.0**.  
All releases are archived on **Zenodo** with both concept and version DOIs.

---

## 8. Future Outlook
The AWO methodology is stabilized at **v1.2**.  
Future work will focus on:

- **CRI-CORE Integration** — Full runtime automation of AWO principles.  
- **Case Study Expansion** — Applying AWO to new domains beyond Waveframe v4.0.  
- **Adoption Frameworks** — Ready-to-use templates and schemas for third-party replicators.
