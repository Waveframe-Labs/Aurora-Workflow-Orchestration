# Neurotransparency Doctrine — Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)

**Definition**  
Neurotransparency is the requirement that every claim-affecting inference be attributable to a declared role and recorded in a durable, verifiable artifact.  
Its goal is to make cognitive processes auditable, enabling deterministic reconstruction of reasoning paths across both human and machine agents.

---

## 1. Purpose
Neurotransparency formalizes cognitive accountability within AWO-compliant workflows.  
It ensures that every reasoning step affecting a claim’s validity — whether generated by a human or an AI model — is traceable, reconstructable, and falsifiable.

---

## 2. Scope
- Applies to all AWO phases (§5): fan-out, consensus, attestation, archival.  
- Extends to all execution contexts: manual, hybrid, or automated (CRI-CORE).  
- Required for both textual (reasoning chains) and computational (model outputs) forms of inference.

---

## 3. Attribution Requirements
Each attested inference must declare:
- **Origin role:** Orchestrator / Evaluator / Auditor / Synthesizer.  
- **Evidence pointer:** Reference path(s) to logs, manifests, or ADRs.  
- **Hash continuity:** Corresponding entry in root `SHA256SUMS.txt`.  
- **Attestation link:** `approval.json` with verified signatures or model attestations.

Failure to declare any of the above results in a **non-conformant inference** (§7).

---

## 4. Recording Patterns
### 4.1 Manual Workflows
- Store a *Reasoning Excerpt* in `/logs/workflow/`, including evidence links and hash digests.  
- Explicitly tag the role responsible for the inference.  
- Timestamp all entries in ISO-8601 format.

### 4.2 Automated Workflows (CRI-CORE)
- Capture configuration context: model IDs, prompt IDs, seeds, hyperparameters.  
- Store deterministic output hashes for all inference results.  
- Maintain a full provenance chain in `provenance/run_manifest.json`.

---

## 5. Verification Protocol
- Each attestation must resolve to at least one verifiable evidence pointer.  
- Hash mismatch, orphaned logs, or undeclared origins trigger an **Attestation FAIL** (§9).  
- Conformance validators SHALL flag missing or inconsistent metadata as doctrinal violations.

---

## 6. Minimum Evidence Schema
```yaml
origin_role: Orchestrator
evidence_pointer:
  - path: logs/workflow/2025-11-07_inference_001.md
    hash: "b39f7a8c9a..."
attestation_link: approvals/2025-11-07_inference_001.json
```  

---

## 7. Non-Conformance

Any claim lacking:

* A declared origin role,
* A valid evidence pointer, or
* Verified hash continuity
  → shall result in **Attestation = FAIL** and may not propagate to archival (§10).

---

## 8. Future Integration

Planned CRI-CORE schema definition:
`/schemas/neurotransparency.schema.json`
will encode mandatory fields for machine-level validation and automated attestation checks.
