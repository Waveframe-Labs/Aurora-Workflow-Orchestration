# Neurotransparency: An Epistemic Primitive for AI–Human Collaboration

**Author:** Shawn C. Wright  
**Affiliation:** Waveframe Labs / Aurora Research Initiative  
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17013612]

## Abstract

**Neurotransparency** is introduced as a methodological requirement ensuring that every claim-affecting inference—whether generated by human or synthetic cognition—is explicitly attributable, traceable, and reconstructible.  
It establishes the epistemic boundary condition for reproducible AI-assisted research: **no reasoning may influence a claim unless its origin and evidence path are recorded.**

As an epistemic primitive, neurotransparency replaces interpretive trust with deterministic auditability.  
It underlies both the **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** methodology and its enforcement layer **CRI-CORE**, forming the ethical and procedural foundation for transparent AI-human reasoning systems.

---

## 1. Definition

> **Neurotransparency (n.)** — the principle that every inference influencing a claim must be attributable to a declared role and recorded in a durable artifact such that the reasoning sequence can be deterministically reconstructed.

Formally, this constitutes a **traceability invariant**:
\[
R_{claim} = f(Evidence, Role, Hash)
\]
where each reasoning contribution is recorded as a tuple *(evidence pointer, role identifier, content hash)* and becomes a permanent element of the project’s provenance ledger.

---

## 2. Motivation

Modern AI-assisted research collapses traditional authorship boundaries: reasoning steps occur across humans, language models, and automated validators.  
Without a deterministic attribution framework, knowledge becomes non-verifiable once the underlying model or context changes.

Existing reproducibility standards focus on data and code.  
**Neurotransparency extends reproducibility to cognition itself**—capturing not just *what* was done but *why* a conclusion was reached, and by whom (or what).

This shift transforms epistemic credibility from a social construct to an evidentiary one.

---

## 3. Implementation in AWO

AWO enforces neurotransparency through three structural guarantees:

| Mechanism | Artifact | Enforcement |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Role Attribution** | `/logs/workflow/`, `/decisions/ADR-NNNN` | Every inference recorded with declared role (Orchestrator, Auditor, Synthesizer, etc.) |
| **Hash Continuity** | `SHA256SUMS.txt` | Every reasoning artifact cryptographically linked to its origin context |
| **Attestation Linkage** | `approval.json` | All validated claims must reference their evidence pointers and hash records |

Failure to provide evidence linkage or role attribution constitutes a **non-conformance** event under §1.6 of the AWO Method Specification.

---

## 4. Enforcement Pathway (CRI-CORE Context)

The upcoming **CRI-CORE** enforcement layer operationalizes neurotransparency through executable schemas:

| Module | Function | Schema Reference |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| `neurotransparency.schema.json` | Defines minimal fields: role, evidence path, hash, timestamp | AWO `/schemas/` |
| `reasoning_ledger.py` | Serializes reasoning steps and assigns deterministic IDs | CRI runtime |
| `attestation_validator.py` | Verifies that every claim references a valid reasoning record | CRI enforcement gate |

CRI-CORE treats neurotransparency as a *first-class constraint*: builds fail if any claim-affecting artifact lacks verifiable provenance.

---

## 5. Ethical and Epistemic Implications

| Principle | Classical Science | Neurotransparent Research |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Authorship** | Singular, human | Distributed, role-based |
| **Reproducibility** | Experimental and data-centric | Cognitive and reasoning-centric |
| **Verification** | Peer review | Deterministic audit |
| **Failure Mode** | Misinterpretation | Missing evidence pointer |

By embedding reasoning transparency into the research substrate, AWO and CRI-CORE redefine *trust* as *trace*.  
This enables a post-institutional form of epistemic governance where credibility is computed, not declared.

---

## 6. Use Cases

1. **Automated Literature Synthesis**  
   Every summarized claim must cite its reasoning path and originating model role.

2. **Scientific Simulation Governance**  
   Parameter selection and model calibration decisions logged as reasoning events, enabling full reconstruction.

3. **Policy or Ethics Review**  
   Deliberative reasoning among AI agents traceable to hash-bound evidence pointers.

4. **Cross-Model Audit**  
   Multiple models perform the same reasoning task; differences become explicit through neurotransparency logs.

---

## 7. Relationship to Adjacent Concepts

| Concept | Relation | Distinction |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Explainability (XAI)** | Post-hoc interpretation | Neurotransparency is pre-registered reasoning capture |
| **Accountability** | Governance outcome | Neurotransparency is evidentiary infrastructure |
| **Provenance** | Historical chain | Neurotransparency is cognitive provenance—who reasoned, not just who edited |
| **Neurosymbolic AI** | Hybrid reasoning architecture | Neurotransparency governs epistemic trace, not computation mode |
