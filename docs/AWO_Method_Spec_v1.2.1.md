# Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)
## Method Specification — v1.2.1 (Scaffold)
Maintainer: Waveframe Labs

---

### Preface
This document defines the **normative specification** for Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO).  
It replaces descriptive or philosophical language with enforceable procedural logic.  
All future automation layers (e.g., CRI-CORE) must validate conformance against these requirements.

**Interpretation of Compliance Language**  
- **MUST** — absolute requirement for AWO-compliant repositories.  
- **SHOULD** — strong recommendation; deviations must be justified in documentation.  
- **MAY** — optional behavior permitted for flexibility.  

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) establishes a formal, falsifiable framework for conducting reproducible AI-assisted research.  
It defines the structural and procedural rules by which reasoning processes—whether human, synthetic, or hybrid—are documented, attested, and version-controlled.

This specification is **methodological**, not philosophical.  
It governs the organization, validation, and archival of reasoning artifacts so that every claim produced under AWO can be independently verified.

---

### 1.2 Scope
This document applies to all research workflows that:

- Integrate AI or automated reasoning systems as active participants in the research process.  
- Produce verifiable artifacts such as manifests, runs, and audit logs.  
- Intend for those artifacts to be **reproducible, falsifiable, and citable**.  

It defines the **minimum structural and procedural requirements** for an AWO-compliant repository, including file hierarchy, provenance recording, versioning, and attestation rules.

AWO does **not** specify runtime behavior or enforcement mechanisms.  
Those are defined in successor frameworks such as **CRI-CORE**, which must implement this specification as their normative foundation.

---

### 1.3 Objectives
The objectives of the AWO standard are to:

1. Encode the **scientific method** as a verifiable workflow rather than a descriptive ideal.  
2. Replace subjective credibility with **objective auditability**.  
3. Ensure that every reasoning artifact—data, model, or decision—can be traced to its origin.  
4. Provide a foundation for automated reproducibility enforcement systems.  
5. Support both manual and fully automated orchestration without altering compliance semantics.

---

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Documents
- The **AWO Whitepaper** provides conceptual background and philosophical rationale.  
- The **AWO Adoption Guide** describes practical implementation and onboarding.  
- This **Method Specification** defines the normative requirements that all AWO artifacts must satisfy.  

Where discrepancies occur, **this specification takes precedence**.

---

### 1.5 Normative References
- **AWO Whitepaper v1.1** (Waveframe Labs)  
- **Aurora Workflow Orchestration Adoption Guide v1.2.1**  
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR-0001 – ADR-0017)** — authoritative design decisions underlying AWO’s structural, governance, and lifecycle model.  
- **CRI-CORE Design Notes** (draft, forthcoming)  
- **ISO/IEC Directives Part 2** — interpretation of compliance terms (“shall,” “should,” “may”)

---

### 1.6 Status of This Version
Version 1.2.1 represents the **finalized methodological form** of AWO under Waveframe Labs governance.  
Future revisions may clarify or extend definitions for CRI-CORE compatibility but will not alter the normative logic without an explicit version increment.

---

## 2. Definitions

This section defines the key entities and concepts used throughout the Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) standard.  
All terms are **normative** unless otherwise specified.

Wherever applicable, definitions align with terminology used in the AWO Whitepaper and will later be cross-referenced to CRI-CORE schema identifiers.

---

### 2.1 Core Entities

**Run**  
A discrete, traceable research execution instance.  
Each Run represents a bounded reasoning process that produces one or more verifiable artifacts and is identified by a unique timestamp or run ID.  
All Runs must be immutable once attested.

**Provenance**  
The complete, chronological lineage of data, logic, parameters, and decisions leading to a result.  
Provenance includes all intermediate steps, transformations, and validations necessary to reproduce a Run.  
In CRI-CORE, this concept maps to the `provenance-ledger` schema.

**Artifact**  
Any persistent output generated within an AWO process.  
Artifacts include reports, manifests, ADRs, checksums, datasets, logs, or schema validation results.  
Artifacts must be versioned, hashable, and linkable to a Run.

**Attestation**  
A confirmation—human, automated, or hybrid—that artifacts produced during a Run are complete, correct, and verified against defined falsifiability criteria.  
Attestations are recorded in `approval.json` and form the evidentiary basis for repository integrity.

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**  
A structured document that records a significant reasoning or design choice, the context in which it was made, and its consequences.  
ADRs form the canonical log of epistemic evolution and are numbered sequentially (`ADR-0001` to `ADR-NNNN`).  
Each Run must reference at least one ADR.

**Manifest (Falsifiability Manifest)**  
A declaration of the hypothesis, predicted outcomes, and explicit disproof conditions for a Run.  
The Manifest defines what constitutes falsification before execution.  
It serves as the precondition for attestation and must be stored under `/docs/`.

---

### 2.2 Secondary Concepts

**Repository**  
The complete version-controlled environment in which all AWO artifacts are stored.  
Every AWO-compliant Repository must maintain a standard directory structure defined in Section 4.

**Role**  
A functional agent—human or synthetic—responsible for a specific epistemic operation within the reasoning lifecycle (see Section 3).  
Roles are procedural, not hierarchical.

**Conformance**  
The degree to which an AWO repository satisfies all mandatory requirements defined in this specification.  
Conformance is binary (pass/fail) for each clause but may include graded compliance levels (“Minimum,” “Standard,” “Full”) as defined in the Adoption Guide.

**Attestation Record**  
The recorded output of a completed review or validation step, stored as a structured file (`approval.json`) under the corresponding Run directory.  
It includes participant identity, timestamp, and signature or digital hash.

---

### 2.3 Future Schema Alignment
All defined entities in this section will be mapped to corresponding CRI-CORE schema classes in later versions.  
Cross-references will be introduced once the enforcement layer is finalized.

**TODO:** Refine definitions list and cross-link to CRI-CORE schema references after CRI draft publication.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
AWO distinguishes between procedural roles to ensure accountability and non-circular validation.

**Primary Roles:**
- **Researcher:** Executes runs and maintains artifacts.  
- **Maintainer:** Oversees repository integrity and version control.  
- **Reviewer:** Performs verification and attestation of completed runs.

**TODO:** Add explicit permissions/responsibilities (who can sign approvals, tag releases, modify manifests).

---

## 4. Repository Requirements
Every AWO project MUST follow a consistent repository layout to ensure verifiability and interoperability.

**Required Directories:**
```
/docs/        → manifests, specs, reports  
/decisions/   → ADRs (0001–NNNN)  
/logs/        → timestamped workflow notes  
/runs/        → attested run artifacts  
/figures/     → diagrams, lifecycle visuals  
```
**TODO:** Add detailed artifact rules and cross-link schema expectations.

---

## 5. Lifecycle and Run Phases
Each research cycle proceeds through four canonical phases:

1. **Fan-out (Planning)** — Define hypotheses, manifests, ADRs.  
2. **Consensus (Execution)** — Perform runs and collect data.  
3. **Attestation (Verification)** — Approve or reject based on falsifiability criteria.  
4. **Archival (Publication)** — Freeze results, compute checksums, tag releases.

**TODO:** Create table describing inputs/outputs for each phase.

---

## 6. Artifacts and File Rules
Every run MUST produce a verifiable set of artifacts:

| File | Description | Required |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| `workflow_frozen.json` | Captures executed parameters and inputs. | Yes |
| `report.md` | Describes outcomes, metrics, and observations. | Yes |
| `approval.json` | Signed validation record by human reviewer. | Yes |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | Hash registry for all outputs. | Yes |
| `manifest.json` or `manifest.md` | Defines falsifiability boundaries. | Yes |

**TODO:** Add versioning, format validation (JSON schema references), and CRI-CORE integration hooks.

---

## 7. Compliance Language
This section defines the mandatory, recommended, and optional behaviors for implementers.

| Level | Definition | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **MUST** | Required for compliance. | Hard validation |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended unless documented exception. | Warning |
| **MAY** | Optional feature. | No enforcement |

**TODO:** Map existing AWO clauses to each compliance level.

---

## 8. Governance and Attestation
Each run requires human or automated attestation of validity and completeness.

**Core Requirements:**
- Runs MUST include `approval.json` with reviewer signature and timestamp.  
- Attestation MAY include checksum verification and peer confirmation.  
- Failed attestations MUST be logged under `/logs/attestation_failures/`.  

**TODO:** Specify acceptable digital signature methods and verification workflows.

---

## 9. Release and Versioning
AWO-compliant repositories MUST version all outputs and preserve immutability.

**Release Requirements:**
- Each release corresponds to a reproducible state of the repository.  
- Tags MUST follow semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.1`).  
- Releases MUST attach PDF artifacts, SHA256SUMS, and ADR references.  
- Released runs MUST NOT be altered post-publication.

**TODO:** Add instructions for checksum regeneration and Zenodo linkage.

---

## 10. Licensing and Attribution
AWO uses dual licensing to separate executable and textual components.

- **Code:** Licensed under Apache 2.0.  
- **Documentation:** Licensed under CC BY 4.0.  
- Attribution MUST include author, ORCID, and concept DOI in derivative works.

**TODO:** Add structured attribution metadata schema reference.

---

## 11. Falsifiability Manifests
Each experiment MUST include a falsifiability manifest before execution.

**Manifest Contents:**
- Hypothesis statement  
- Predicted outcomes  
- Disproof criteria  
- Experimental plan  
- Acceptance thresholds  
- Known risks

**TODO:** Formalize manifest schema for CRI-CORE parsing.

---

## 12. Conformance Checklist
Each repository MUST pass the following before claiming AWO compliance:

- [ ] Standard directory structure present.  
- [ ] At least one signed run in `/runs/`.  
- [ ] ADRs and falsifiability manifests linked.  
- [ ] SHA256SUMS.txt present at root.  
- [ ] PDF artifacts built successfully.  
- [ ] CHANGELOG includes version reference.  
- [ ] README links to Whitepaper, Method Spec, Adoption Guide.  

**TODO:** Add automated compliance script references (future CRI module).

---

## 13. Appendix C — Rationale Summary (Reserved)
**TODO:** When the Method Spec text is finalized, reintroduce Appendix C summarizing why each rule exists in concise bullet form.  
(Placeholder retained for structural continuity.)
