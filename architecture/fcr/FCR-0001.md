# Formal Change Request — FCR-0001
**Status:** draft  
**Type:** architecture-change  
**Governance:** ARI  
**Requested by:** Shawn C. Wright (ORCID: 0009-0006-6043-9295)  
**Date Submitted:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Affected Architecture Version:** v1.4  
**Target Architecture Version:** v1.5 (proposed)

## 1. Summary
Provide a concise description of the proposed architecture change.

- What is being changed?
- Why is this change necessary now?
- Is this a correction, addition, removal, or structural refactor?

---

## 2. Motivation
Explain the reasoning behind the proposed change.

Questions to answer:

- What architectural, workflow, or governance issue does this address?
- What new requirement, discovery, or constraint triggered this?
- Is the change required for:
  - invariants?
  - metadata policies?
  - governance alignment?
  - CRI workflow?
  - DAG/backlog coherence?

---

## 3. Scope of Change
List all directly affected artifacts.

Examples:

- `/architecture/AWO_DAG_FULL-EXPANSION.md`
- `/architecture/AWO_BACKLOG-LEDGER_v1.4.md`
- `/architecture/CPP_v1.0.md`
- Invariants Document
- Metadata Policy
- Method Spec
- NTS (Neurotransparency Spec)
- CRI workflow
- Versioning Protocol
- Kernel definitions

Note any new files added or removed.

---

## 4. Dependency & DAG Impact
Describe how this change affects system dependencies.

Be explicit:

- Does it add or remove parent/child edges in the DAG?
- Does the Critical Path (CPP) change?
- Does the backlog need re-tiering?
- Does this impact root primitives (1, 2, or 4)?
- Does the Neurotrans Spec (26) or Method Spec Sync (6) shift?

If this change affects **(1), (2), or (4)** →  
**Flag as a Breaking Architecture Change.**

---

## 5. Compatibility & Migration
Document backward compatibility considerations.

- Is this change backward-compatible?  
- Does it deprecate or invalidate prior behaviors?
- Does it affect kernels, CRI workflows, metadata expectations, or governance rules?
- Does this require migration of existing artifacts or documentation?

For breaking changes, provide:

- a migration strategy  
- deprecation window (if applicable)  
- archival references to superseded versions  

---

## 6. Proposed Changes (Exact Edits)
Describe each change in a patch-like format.

Use clear, explicit diffs or bullet lists.

Example format:
```
File: architecture/AWO_DAG_FULL-EXPANSION.md   
Change:  
-Add new dependency edge: (16) → (29)  
-Remove outdated child under (6): Badge System (7)  
-Update section headings for clarity
```

If needed, attach images, diagrams, or supporting materials under:
```
/architecture/fcr/attachments/FCR-0001/
```

---

## 7. Validation & Checks
List the validation actions required after applying this change.

Typical checks include:

- DAG validation  
- Backlog coherence check  
- CPP alignment  
- Doc Guard pass  
- Metadata pipeline pass (once active)  
- Schema validation (invariants, ledger, reasoning record)  
- Run History invariants  
- Versioning protocol compliance  
- Kernel self-check (if impacted)

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation
Identify risks introduced by the change and mitigation steps.

Examples:

- risk of dependency drift  
- risk of metadata inconsistencies  
- risk of breaking kernel validation  
- risk of governance contradiction  
- risk of confusing external adopters

Provide proposed mitigation strategies.
