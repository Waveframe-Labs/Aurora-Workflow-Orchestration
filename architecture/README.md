# Architecture Baseline (AWO/CRI)

This directory contains the **frozen architecture baseline** for the  
Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) and Continuous Research Integration (CRI) system.

These documents define the **dependency graph**, **execution order**,  
and **governance-stable architecture** of the AWO/CRI ecosystem.  
They serve as the canonical reference for reconstructing the system  
from first principles.

All files in this directory are:

- **baseline / frozen**
- **architecture-level artifacts**
- subject to **Formal Change Requests (FCRs)** for modification
- awaiting metadata headers that will later be auto-generated by the metadata pipeline

No document in this directory should be edited directly without following ARI governance.

## Contents

### **1. AWO_BACKLOG-LEDGER_v1.4.md**
The full, DAG-aligned backlog of the AWO/CRI system.
Defines the execution tiers, task groupings, and correct ordering of work.

### **2. AWO_DAG_FULL-EXPANSION.md**
The complete dependency graph (DAG) of the system.
Shows parent → child relationships across:
- invariants  
- workflow  
- governance  
- metadata  
- spec  
- demos  
- decision gates  

This file is the authoritative representation of system architecture.

### **3. CPP_v1.0.md**
The human-readable **Critical Path Plan** for system execution.
Represents the minimum feasible sequence of tasks required to reach full system stability.
Derived directly from the DAG.

### **4. CPP_v1.0.json**
Machine-readable version of the Critical Path Plan.
Intended for:
- tooling  
- validation  
- visualizers  
- metadata pipelines  
- automated planning tools
