# Architecture Baseline (AWO/CRI)

This directory contains the **frozen architecture baseline** for the  
Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) and Continuous Research Integration (CRI) system.

These documents define the **dependency graph**, **execution order**,  
and **governance-stable architecture** of the AWO/CRI ecosystem.  
They serve as the canonical reference for reconstructing the system  
from first principles.

All files in this directory are:

- **baseline / frozen**
- **architecture-level artifacts**
- subject to **Formal Change Requests (FCRs)** for modification
- awaiting metadata headers that will later be auto-generated by the metadata pipeline

No document in this directory should be edited directly without following ARI governance.

## Contents

### **1. AWO_BACKLOG-LEDGER_v1.4.md**
The full, DAG-aligned backlog of the AWO/CRI system.
Defines the execution tiers, task groupings, and correct ordering of work.

### **2. AWO_DAG_FULL-EXPANSION.md**
The complete dependency graph (DAG) of the system.
Shows parent → child relationships across:
- invariants  
- workflow  
- governance  
- metadata  
- spec  
- demos  
- decision gates  

This file is the authoritative representation of system architecture.

### **3. CPP_v1.0.md**
The human-readable **Critical Path Plan** for system execution.
Represents the minimum feasible sequence of tasks required to reach full system stability.
Derived directly from the DAG.

### **4. CPP_v1.0.json**
Machine-readable version of the Critical Path Plan.
Intended for:
- tooling  
- validation  
- visualizers  
- metadata pipelines  
- automated planning tools

## Status

All documents in this folder are currently classified as:  
- status: baseline / frozen
- governance: ARI Architecture Document
- metadata: pending (to be auto-inserted by Metadata Pipeline v1)

Once the metadata pipeline is implemented, each document will receive:

- a fully structured metadata header  
- its own DOI or DOI placeholder  
- version lineage tracking  
- governance annotations  
- automatic validation

## Modification Process (FCR Required)

To modify any file in this directory:

1. Create a new **Formal Change Request (FCR)** under:
```
/architecture/fcr/
```
2. Document:
- rationale  
- proposed changes  
- affected architecture nodes  
- compatibility impact  
3. Assign a new version number (e.g., `v1.4 → v1.5`)
4. Submit the FCR for review via ARI governance
5. After approval:
- modify the file(s)
- update metadata
- commit changes with the FCR ID

No direct edits are permitted.

## Purpose of This Directory

This directory exists so that:

- AWO/CRI can be **reconstructed** without ambiguity  
- governance rules remain **stable**  
- the architecture is **transparent**  
- future contributors cannot unintentionally change system structure  
- metadata generation can operate reproducibly  
- DOIs can reference specific architecture versions  
- the project scales into a **standards-grade ecosystem**

This folder is the “source of truth” for AWO/CRI architecture.
