AUDIT:
  model_id: "claude-sonnet-4"
  file: "README.md"
  scope: "Documentation quality, positioning, implementation guidance, and accessibility"
  findings:
    - id: "DOC-001"
      category: docs
      severity: medium
      location: "Skills Demonstrated section"
      statement: "The skills list lacks evidence or examples connecting claimed abilities to framework implementation."
      evidence: "• Applied analysis → translating orchestration into science, business, and social domains."
      reproduction: "Read through the skills section and note the absence of specific examples or case references"
      fix_suggestion: "Add brief examples after each skill item, such as 'Applied analysis → demonstrated in customer review case study achieving X% accuracy improvement'"
      confidence: 0.9

    - id: "DOC-002"  
      category: reproducibility
      severity: high
      location: "What This Is section"
      statement: "Claims about reproducibility and auditability lack concrete implementation details or success metrics."
      evidence: "makes AI projects transparent, auditable, and transferable"
      reproduction: "Search document for specific metrics, benchmarks, or quantified evidence of these claims"
      fix_suggestion: "Add a brief 'Evidence' subsection with preliminary results, user testimonials, or comparative metrics"
      confidence: 0.8

    - id: "DOC-003"
      category: docs
      severity: medium
      location: "Workflow Cycle section"
      statement: "The 'Validate' step lacks concrete examples of what validation means across different project types."
      evidence: "3. Validate → Stress-test outputs with logic, data, or constraints."
      reproduction: "Review the workflow cycle and note the abstract nature of the validation description"
      fix_suggestion: "Expand with domain-specific validation examples: 'For data analysis: cross-validation and statistical tests; For literature reviews: source verification and bias checks'"
      confidence: 0.85

    - id: "DOC-004"
      category: docs
      severity: low
      location: "Deliverables section"
      statement: "Promises a case study demonstration but provides only a placeholder reference."
      evidence: "The first applied demonstration (customer review analysis) is under development and will be linked here when published."
      reproduction: "Check for actual links or examples of deliverables in the repository"
      fix_suggestion: "Either provide a concrete timeline for case study completion or reference available preliminary materials"
      confidence: 0.7

    - id: "DOC-005"
      category: docs
      severity: medium
      location: "Overall structure"
      statement: "Missing implementation guidance for new users wanting to adopt the AWO framework."
      evidence: "Entire README lacks 'Getting Started' or 'Quick Start' section"
      reproduction: "Scan document for step-by-step guidance on framework adoption"
      fix_suggestion: "Add a 'Getting Started' section with 3-5 concrete steps for first-time users"
      confidence: 0.9

    - id: "DOC-006"
      category: docs
      severity: low
      location: "Roadmap section"
      statement: "Temporal organization could be clearer with estimated timeframes or completion criteria."
      evidence: "Instead of fixed timelines, progress is tracked in phases"
      reproduction: "Review roadmap items and note absence of completion indicators"
      fix_suggestion: "Add approximate timeframes or measurable completion criteria for each roadmap item"
      confidence: 0.6

    - id: "DOC-007"
      category: docs
      severity: medium
      location: "In-repo Guarantees section"
      statement: "Section promises audit capabilities but doesn't explain how users can actually perform audits."
      evidence: "If it can't be audited, it doesn't count. AWO optimizes for honest, inspectable workflows over theatrics."
      reproduction: "Look for specific instructions on how to audit AWO implementations"
      fix_suggestion: "Add a brief explanation of audit procedures or reference specific audit templates in the /templates directory"
      confidence: 0.8

    - id: "DOC-008"
      category: docs
      severity: low
      location: "Banner image reference"
      statement: "Image path may not resolve correctly depending on viewing context."
      evidence: "src=\"figures/AI-Workflow-Orchestration-Banner.PNG\""
      reproduction: "View README on different platforms (GitHub web, raw text, local clone) to verify image rendering"
      fix_suggestion: "Consider using absolute GitHub URLs for images or verify path consistency across viewing contexts"

notes: The README demonstrates sophisticated thinking about AI research methodology and addresses real problems in the field. The framework positioning as methodology rather than tooling is strategically sound. Main improvements needed are concrete implementation guidance, evidence of effectiveness claims, and more specific examples throughout. The document would benefit from a user-focused "how to get started" section and clearer validation examples across different domains.
