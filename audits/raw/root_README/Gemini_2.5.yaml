  findings:
    - id: "READ-001"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "low"
      location: "What This Is section"
      statement: "The introductory section could be more concise to immediately capture reader attention."
      evidence: "The paragraph explaining what AWO is, is several sentences long."
      reproduction: "Read the 'What This Is' section from the perspective of a first-time visitor with limited time."
      fix_suggestion: "Rephrase the introductory text to be a single, punchy paragraph or a clear heading followed by a single sentence."
      confidence: 0.9
    - id: "READ-002"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "low"
      location: "Entire document"
      statement: "A dedicated 'Getting Started' section would provide a clearer path for new users."
      evidence: "The README explains what the project is, but not a step-by-step first action."
      reproduction: "Attempt to find the first action to take after reading the entire README, such as which file to open first."
      fix_suggestion: "Add a new section titled 'Getting Started' that links directly to the core method spec and templates."
      confidence: 0.9
    - id: "READ-003"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "nit"
      location: "Image sections"
      statement: "The use of non-standard HTML `<p align='center'>` for image alignment may not be universally supported by all Markdown renderers."
      evidence: "`<p align='center'>` is not standard Markdown syntax."
      reproduction: "Try rendering the README on a different platform that does not support raw HTML, like some static site generators."
      fix_suggestion: "Remove the HTML tags and use standard Markdown image syntax. If centered alignment is a strong requirement, note that it may not render correctly everywhere."
