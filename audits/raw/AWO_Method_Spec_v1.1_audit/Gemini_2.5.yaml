  findings:
    - id: "METH-001"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "low"
      location: "Lifecycle (one iteration) section"
      statement: "The lifecycle description is text-heavy and could be improved with visual aids for better scannability."
      evidence: "A numbered list without any visual elements to break up the text."
      reproduction: "Read the 'Lifecycle (one iteration)' section. Notice the density of the text compared to the README's visual diagram."
      fix_suggestion: "Consider creating or referencing a flowchart or diagram to illustrate the workflow cycle, similar to the one in the main README."
      confidence: 0.9
    - id: "METH-002"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "low"
      location: "Falsifiability"
      statement: "The definition of falsifiability could be elaborated with a small concrete example for clarity."
      evidence: "Every claim MUST have a concrete test that could prove it wrong (dataset/criteria/procedure)."
      reproduction: "A reader may understand the concept of falsifiability but struggle to apply it directly without an example."
      fix_suggestion: "Add a brief, parenthetical example after the definition, e.g., '(e.g., 'Model X's output for task Y is consistently >95% accurate on dataset Z with criteria W')'."
      confidence: 0.8
    - id: "METH-003"
      category: "docs"
      severity: "nit"
      location: "Roles section"
      statement: "The term 'Main Model (Continuity)' could be slightly ambiguous and may benefit from a brief explanation of 'continuity'."
      evidence: "'Main Model (Continuity): maintains project memory and produces the primary draft/synthesis.'"
      reproduction: "A reader might wonder what 'continuity' means in this context."
      fix_suggestion: "Expand the explanation slightly, e.g., '...maintains project memory and continuity, producing the primary draft/synthesis.'"
      confidence: 0.7

notes:
  - "The method specification is exceptionally well-structured and detailed. It's a professional and robust document."
  - "The use of `MUST/SHOULD` is a great practice, clearly defining requirements versus recommendations."
  - "The document's structure, with sections for scope, roles, artifacts, and lifecycle, is logical and easy to follow."
  - "The Conformance Checklist is a particularly strong feature, providing a clear way to verify adherence to the method."
  - "The findings are minor and primarily focus on enhancing clarity and scannability for a wider audience."
