AUDIT:
  model_id: GPT-5
  file: AI-Workflow-Orchestration-main/docs/AWO_Method_Spec_v1.1.md
  scope: Documentation quality (method specification clarity, completeness, enforceability)
  findings:
  - id: DOCS-007
    category: docs
    severity: high
    location: Normative Requirements section
    statement: Requirements use RFC-style "MUST/SHOULD" language but lack formal criteria for verification.
    evidence: "Requirement 1: 'Every claim MUST have a concrete test that could prove it wrong'."
    reproduction: Attempt to map these requirements into testable acceptance criteria; ambiguity remains.
    fix_suggestion: Add a compliance matrix linking each requirement to measurable verification procedures.
    confidence: 0.9
  - id: DOCS-008
    category: reproducibility
    severity: medium
    location: Roles section
    statement: The responsibilities of auditors are described narratively without specifying independence enforcement.
    evidence: "Auxiliary Auditors (Independent): Logic Auditor, Data Validator, Peer Critic."
    reproduction: Review section for constraints on overlap between roles; none are provided.
    fix_suggestion: Specify rules preventing role conflicts (e.g., same model/human cannot serve in multiple independent roles).
    confidence: 0.85
  - id: DOCS-009
    category: reproducibility
    severity: medium
    location: Core Artifacts section
    statement: References to artifacts assume directories exist but do not specify required file formats or schemas.
    evidence: "Evidence Registry (`/figures`, `/notebooks`, `/data`) — referenced from the manifest and logs."
    reproduction: Attempt to check repo; some paths exist but no explicit format/schema described.
    fix_suggestion: Define required metadata/schema for each artifact type (e.g., JSON for evidence registry).
    confidence: 0.8
  - id: DOCS-010
    category: docs
    severity: low
    location: Lifecycle section
    statement: Lifecycle steps are described clearly but lack timing/frequency guidance.
    evidence: "0. Setup → 6. Release gate."
    reproduction: Review lifecycle; no reference to iteration length or cadence.
    fix_suggestion: Add guidance on iteration frequency (e.g., per hypothesis, per week, per dataset change).
    confidence: 0.75
  - id: DOCS-011
    category: docs
    severity: low
    location: Logging Schema section
    statement: Minimum fields are defined but no format (YAML, JSON, Markdown table) is mandated.
    evidence: "*Log entry:* date, what I did, what I learned, next step, skills."
    reproduction: Check repo logs — formats vary.
    fix_suggestion: Define a standard logging format (e.g., front-matter YAML + Markdown body).
    confidence: 0.8
  - id: DOCS-012
    category: docs
    severity: nit
    location: Conformance Checklist section
    statement: Checklist items are helpful but lack direct links to examples in this repo.
    evidence: "- [ ] Manifest exists with at least one falsifiable claim..."
    reproduction: Follow checklist references; no hyperlinks to specific files provided.
    fix_suggestion: Add direct links to manifest, ADR, and release artifacts in this repository.
    confidence: 0.7
