      reproduction: "Review the requirement and note absence of examples or minimum standards for test adequacy"
      fix_suggestion: "Add examples of adequate vs inadequate falsifiability tests, such as 'Adequate: Model accuracy >85% on holdout dataset X. Inadequate: Model performs well on unseen data.'"

      reproduction: "Consider how 'independence' is achieved when all auditors are AI models potentially sharing training data and biases"

notes: This specification shows sophisticated understanding of research methodology and addresses key reproducibility challenges. The structure is logical and the requirements are generally well-motivated. However, the specification would benefit from more concrete implementation guidance, clearer independence criteria for AI auditors, and expanded examples across domains. The falsifiability requirements are conceptually sound but need operational definitions to be practically implementable.
