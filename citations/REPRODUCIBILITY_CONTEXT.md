# Reproducibility & Workflow Integrity — Supporting Evidence for AWO

This file collects **non-AI-generated citations and insights from research** that substantiate the principles behind AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO). Each point connects directly to AWO’s requirements: falsifiability, reproducibility, auditability, and portability.

## 1. Reproducibility of AI is Lacking (needs structure)
- Studies report that fewer than one-third of AI/ML papers share test data or source code, making verification difficult [Hutson2018].  
- Analyses highlight common issues in published AI research — data leakage, methodological flaws, and exaggerated results that often collapse under replication [Lipton2018].  
- A replication study of 30 influential AI papers found only ~50% were at least partially reproducible. Shared code and data were the strongest predictors of success [Henderson2018].  

*Why it matters for AWO:*  
AWO treats falsifiability and logging as first-class artifacts. Every claim has a test, threshold, and outcome recorded, directly addressing this reproducibility gap.

## 2. Scientific Workflow Systems Prove Methodological Reliability
- **Nextflow** is widely cited as enabling scalable, reproducible, and portable computation across diverse platforms [DiTommaso2017].  
- **Galaxy**, originally for bioinformatics, has grown into a domain-agnostic workflow manager focused on reproducibility and accessibility [Afgan2018].  
- Reviews of systems such as **Nextflow, CWL, and WDL** show they improve reproducibility and portability in complex research pipelines [Goble2020].  

*Why it matters for AWO:*  
AWO extends this logic beyond data pipelines into reasoning workflows — logs, ADRs, and falsifiability manifests make AI reasoning itself reproducible.

---

## 3. Transparency and Auditability Build Trust
- Researchers such as **Joelle Pineau (McGill/Meta)** have advanced reproducibility checklists and model documentation (“model cards,” “Show Your Work”) to raise standards in AI [Mitchell2019].  
- Meta-research consistently identifies transparency and open workflows as core remedies to the replication crisis [Ioannidis2005].  

*Why it matters for AWO:*  
AWO formalizes transparency by requiring dialogue logs, ADRs, and independent audits, ensuring that reasoning steps are inspectable.

---

## 4. AI-Human Collaboration Needs Structured Frameworks
- Surveys of European AI PhD students highlight reproducibility barriers: lack of shared code/datasets, unverifiable experiments, and weak cross-disciplinary collaboration [Pineau2021].  
- Reviews of ML-driven research stress that documentation alone is insufficient — structural practices and tools are needed to guarantee reproducibility [Hutson2020].  

*Why it matters for AWO:*  
AWO defines explicit roles (Main Model, Logic/Data/Peer Auditors, Orchestrator) and enforces rejection loops, making collaboration between AI and humans systematic, not ad hoc.
