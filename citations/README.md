# Citations — Reproducibility Context

**Purpose**  
This directory anchors **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** in verifiable, peer-reviewed research on reproducibility and scientific workflow integrity.  
It collects *non-AI-generated* sources that justify AWO’s methodological requirements — **falsifiability**, **reproducibility**, **auditability**, and **portability**.

---

## Contents

- **`REPRODUCIBILITY_CONTEXT.md`** — A curated review of reproducibility scholarship and workflow-system research.  
  Each citation directly supports one of AWO’s normative principles.  
  Includes BibTeX references for archival use.

---

## How It Fits in AWO

This file functions as the **empirical backbone** for AWO’s epistemic claims:  
- Validates that AWO’s design addresses well-documented reproducibility gaps.  
- Provides traceable academic precedent for every methodological decision (see ADR-0002 and ADR-0005).  
- Ensures AWO remains grounded in open-science standards, not just AI-generated reasoning.

---

## Maintenance Policy

- Update only with verified, *human-curated* research (no AI-synthesized sources).  
- Add new citations when they reinforce or challenge AWO’s methodology.  
- Maintain BibTeX compatibility for export to Zenodo or CSL formats.  
- Record all updates in the changelog with commit metadata (author, date, rationale).
